AB  - Mr. G is a 38-year-old married father of a 10-year-old girl and a 7- year-old boy. Mr. G was doing well until about 2 years ago. He was at home one evening watching his children while his wife was traveling on business. He suddenly noted feeling hot, sweating, and feeling dizzy. He called 911 and was taken to an emergency room. He was diagnosed with an acute anxiety episode secondary to a mild iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. His thyroid medication was lowered, but he continued to have problems with anxiety, and he noted for the first time worrisome thoughts about possibly hurting his children if he was home alone with them at night. His internist referred him for a brief psychiatric hospitalization. Mr. G said his inpatient psychiatrists considered a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but he eventually was discharged with diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder. Although he could become quite anxious when having thoughts about hurting his children, his baseline anxiety was well-controlled on gabapentin at a dose of 600 mg twice per day, but he already felt somewhat tired on it at times. He showed no signs of mania, hypomania, or depressed mood, but he felt somewhat demoralized at times because of the difficulties these painful thoughts caused for him. Therefore, his psychopharmacologist referred him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. Mr. G and his therapist examined whether the thoughts were bringing on the anxiety or the anxiety was bringing on the thoughts. Through his therapy, he realized that, in fact, he had no thoughts of wanting to harm the child or feelings of anger; he was anxious precisely because he didn't want the children to be hurt and because he feared the painful shame he felt whenever he had one of these images. Mr. G received two types of CBT, primarily behavioral therapy (predominantly exposure and response prevention) for his OCD, and Beck's cognitive therapy for his residual anxiety and shame. At the end of his therapy, Mr. G was requiring less medication, and he and his psychopharmacologist were in the process of tapering it with the goal of discontinuing it.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) has proven to be an effective treatment modality for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Less research exists demonstrating efficacy for this treatment modality among children with comorbid diagnoses of OCD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and virtually, nothing has been reported examining intensive interventions for the most severe cases. As such, this article discusses the treatment of an adolescent male with severe OCD comorbid with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and chronic tic disorder using a cognitive behavioral approach and ERP. We conclude with recommendations for continued clinical research to understand approaches to help nonresponders to standard therapeutic approaches with this challenging population.

AB  - Presents the case of a 16-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a paraphilic disorder who was successfully treated using intensive exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Kevin participated in a partial-hospitalization CBT-oriented program for four weeks. At intake, he was prescribed vortioxetine and clonazepam. Aripiprazole was added nine days after admission, and guanfacine ER was added five days later.. At intake, Kevin’s scores on the PROMIS Pediatric Depression Scale and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children/Adolescents (LSAS) decreased from 69 to 43 and 65 to 30, respectively, reflecting significant improvement (i.e., probable to unlikely social anxiety; moderate to no significant depressive symptoms). On the Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q), Kevin’s scores improved from 52 to 68, corresponding with the 68th and 96th percentiles, respectively. Short term unstructured follow-up that took place via telephone four months post-treatment indicated that Kevin maintained treatment gains. This case suggests the utility of an intensive exposure-based CBT protocol in combination with pharmacotherapy in a motivated adolescent with paraphilia.

AB  - Two case studies are presented to demonstrate that children who experience trauma-related nightmares may benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy for this sleep problem. The treatment was adapted from the empirically supported adult treatment for chronic trauma-related nightmares: exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (ERRT). Pretreatment and posttreatment nightmare frequency and severity were measured in addition to subjective nightmare-related distress, behavioral problems, sleep quality and quantity, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Improvement in nightmare and sleep disturbance frequencies were found as well as reductions in parents’ reports of child behavior problems. This study provides preliminary support for the use of ERRT with children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Empirical support exists for behaviorally oriented psychosocial interventions to reduce functional impairment related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms in young children, but little research exists examining the effectiveness of such treatments when applied to preschool-aged children with comorbid anxiety symptoms. With this in mind, the authors report on the case of 'Marcus,' a 4-year-old boy with autistic disorder and impairing comorbid anxiety. Marcus participated in 8 weekly sessions of family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy, addressing his fear-based avoidance of social interactions and sensory stimuli, using an anxiety treatment protocol for youth with ASD modified to account for his young age. This protocol consisted of modular components addressing affective education, exposure, cognitive restructuring, and social coaching. At post-treatment assessment, Marcus exhibited markedly decreased impairment, as evidenced by parent responses to clinical interview and rating scales. In addition, Marcus displayed improvement in severity of anxiety symptoms as illustrated by a decrease in his scores on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale from 17 at baseline to 8 at post-treatment. Therapeutic gains were maintained at 4-month follow-up. Implications and clinical considerations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This case study involves a 12-year-old boy, Erik, with cognitive difficulties, who also suffered from multiple anxiety disorders (specifically, he met the diagnostic criteria of Generalized Anxiety, Specific Phobias, Social Phobia, and Separation Anxiety). Erik and his family were treated for 10 sessions over three months with the 'Cool Kids ' cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program developed by Ronald Rapee and his colleagues (Rapee et al., 2006). The treatment took place in a university training clinic in Aarhus, Denmark. CBT was conducted in a group format, with both children and their families taking an active part, and included cognitive restructuring, gradual exposure, child management training, and skills training in areas such as assertiveness. Results show that therapy effectively reduced the child’s anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Children and Parents (ADIS-IV P/C) and by the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). Additional quantitative and qualitative data indicate an overall positive therapeutic outcome, which was maintained at 3 months and 15 months after the conclusion of treatment. A primary aim of the case study was to investigate the mechanisms of change leading to success in Erik's case, focusing on the role of parental inclusion in the therapy and the necessary accommodations made to the child’s cognitive developmental level. For example, through parents’ engagement in therapy, it was possible to alter their expectations and behaviors, with Erik’s mother learning how to be less overprotective and control her own anxiety, functioning as a positive role model for her child. Furthermore, the present study stresses the significance of accommodating the treatment to the child’s cognitive developmental level, such that Erik’s cognitions were initially challenged successfully through gradual exposures and only later addressed with cognitive restructuring, aided by the treatment given to his parents and Erik’s advancing cognitive maturation.

AB  - This case study involves a therapy group of four boys and two girls aged 8-12 who suffered from multiple anxiety disorders. The children and their families were treated for 10 sessions over three months with the 'Cool Kids' cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program developed by Rapee and his colleagues (2006). The treatment, which took place in a university training clinic in Aarhus, Denmark, was conducted in a group format, with both children and their families taking an active part, and included cognitive restructuring, gradual exposure, child management training, and skills training in areas such as assertiveness. Outcome was measured by change over time on standardized self-report measures, on diagnosis, and on an overall judgment based on all the data on a 'Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of Anxiety Scale' ('CGI-I'). Four of the cases, the 'responders,' showed successful outcomes on standardized measures, while two, the 'nonresponders,' did not. This case study looks both qualitatively and quantitatively at the process and outcome of each child and family, exploring the differences between the responders and nonresponders.

AB  - More than two thirds of children in the general population report exposure to at least one traumatic event by the age of 16 (Copeland, Keeler, Angold, & Costello, 2007). In addition to high prevalence rates of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the children exposed to trauma have almost double the rates of developing psychiatric disorders such as affective and anxiety disorders than those not exposed (Copeland et al., 2007). Evidence-based psychological interventions are clearly needed to address these psychiatric difficulties; however, the treatment outcome literature for traumatized children is limited as compared to the breadth published for adults (Feeny, Foa, Treadwell, & March, 2004). Furthermore, research disseminating the treatment outcome literature is even sparser as only one meta-analysis has examined all trauma types and reactions in traumatized children (Silverman et al., 2008). Results from this meta-analysis revealed that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy resulted in statistically significant treatment effects for Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (d=.50) (Silverman et al., 2008). Although, this research filled a gap in the treatment outcome literature for traumatized children, the strict article inclusion criteria left many studies out of the analysis. The present research attempts to build upon the research of Silverman et al. (2008) by widening the inclusion criteria and more than tripling the amount of research studies included in the analysis. In fact, this present meta-analysis identified 67 usable studies (61 published journal articles and six dissertations). The most commonly utilized form of treatment was general CBT (20.9%), followed by TF-CBT (16.4%). In general, CBT interventions were more commonly used than non-CBT interventions (respectively, 58.2%, 41.8%). These interventions were more often conducted in a group format (40.3%); however, individual therapy was also a highly utilized form of treatment delivery (34.3%). A large overall trauma within group unweighted effect size was found (M=0.80;  SD=0.68) which indicates that after receiving treatment for trauma, children and adolescents demonstrated positive changes on the outcome measures. Effect sizes were also examined by treatment type, construct used to measure change, service delivery method, duration of treatment, and setting of treatment. This was the first meta-analysis of trauma with children and adolescents to examine effect size as a function of who was reporting change, and the largest effect sizes were found for ratings by structured interview, followed by clinician-report, self-report, parent report, and teacher report, with structured interview being the only significantly different rating. A medium to large positive effect size was found for the overall comparison of trauma treatment to control groups. A small to medium positive effect size was found for the overall comparison of TF-CBT to alternative groups. Limitations and implications for school psychologists are discussed.

AB  - Children who have been exposed to trauma have their typical course of development altered. Trauma exposure can have a lasting, physical impact on brain development, which changes the child's behavioral and psychological functioning. Treatment efforts to repair the effects of trauma exposure are seen as daunting and time-intensive. The current mental health system in the United States is not fully equipped to deal with the substantial number of children who are exposed to trauma. The school system is the largest mental health providers in the country and is uniquely able to provide supportive services to children affected by trauma. The present study analyzed data from a single-case design aimed at examining the effectiveness of a modified manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focused on reducing anxiety symptoms in a male child who experienced sexual trauma. The study incorporated CBT principles with neuropsychological theory, which allowed for the intersection between behavioral principles and brain-behavior relationships in order to identify the child's developmental level and neurocognitive strengths and weaknesses. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Coping CAT, a CBT, manualized intervention, designed to reduce anxiety in elementary age children, over the course of 14 individual sessions. The results of the study were mixed due to the participant's underreporting of symptoms on outcome measures. The participant reported fewer symptoms of feeling tense or restless at the conclusion of the intervention, but did not report his overall anxiety levels to be lower. However, reports from his classroom teachers suggested that the participant did have a reduction in his overall levels of anxiety. This study offers promise for using neuropsychological principles to target intervention goals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Research on the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction has led to the examination of D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the amygdala, as a method to enhance exposure therapy outcome. Preliminary results have supported the use of DCS to augment exposure therapy in adult anxiety disorders; however, no data have been reported in any childhood anxiety disorder. Thus, we sought to preliminarily examine whether weight-adjusted DCS doses (25 or 50 mg) enhanced the overall efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Method: Participants were 30 youth (aged 8–17) with a primary diagnosis of OCD. The study design was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled augmentation trial examining CBT + DCS versus CBT + Placebo (15 youth per group). All patients received seven exposure and response prevention sessions paired with DCS or placebo taken 1 hour before sessions. Results: Although not significantly different, compared with the CBT + Placebo group, youth in the CBT + DCS arm showed small-to-moderate treatment effects (d = .31–.47 on primary outcomes). No adverse events were recorded. Conclusions: These results complement findings in adult OCD and non-OCD anxiety disorders and provide initial support for a more extensive study of DCS augmentation of CBT among youth with OCD.

AB  - Objective: The 1-year outcome and moderators of adjustment for children and youth receiving treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following single-incident trauma was examined. Method: Children and youth who had experienced single-incident trauma (N = 33; 7–17 years old) were randomly assigned to receive 9 weeks of either trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or trauma-focused cognitive therapy (without exposure; CT) that was administered to them and their parents individually. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated that both groups maintained posttreatment gains in PTSD, depression and general anxiety symptoms reductions at 1-year follow-up, with no children meeting criteria for PTSD. A large proportion of children showed good end-state functioning at follow-up (CBT: 65%; CT: 71%). Contrary to 6-month outcomes, maternal adjustment no longer moderated children’s outcome, nor did any other tested variables. Conclusion: The findings confirm the positive longer-term outcomes of using trauma-focused cognitive–behavioral methods for PTSD secondary to single-incident trauma and that these outcomes are not dependent on the use of exposure.

AB  - The present study compared the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with trauma-focused cognitive therapy (without exposure; CT) for children and youth with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Children and youth who had experienced single-incident trauma (N = 33; 7–17 years old) were randomly assigned to receive 9 weeks of either CBT or CT which was administered individually to children and their parents. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated that both interventions significantly reduced severity of PTSD, depression, and general anxiety. At posttreatment 65% of CBT and 56% of the CT group no longer met criteria for PTSD. Treatment completers showed a better response (CBT: 91%; CT: 90%), and gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Maternal depressive symptoms and unhelpful trauma beliefs moderated children’s outcome. It is concluded that PTSD secondary to single-incident trauma can be successfully treated with trauma-focused cognitive behavioural methods and the use of exposure is not a prerequisite for good outcome.

AB  - Although the diagnosis of PTSD, when first formulated in 1980, was not believed to be relevant to children and adolescents. It is now well accepted that children and adolescents can develop PTSD following life-threatening traumatic events. The diagnosis of PTSD in children and adolescents is almost isomorphic to the adult core criteria: (1) after exposure to actual or threatened death or serious injury instead of evidencing fear, helplessness or horror they may respond with disorganised or agitated behaviour; (2) symptoms of re-experiencing, repetition and reenactments where children may manifest repetitive behaviours, play re-enactments of the traumatic situation or frightening dreams without specific content. Although CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and especially TF-CBT (trauma- focused CBT) are the most well documented intervention methods for traumatised children, the samples involved in the studies are relatively small. The sample size also makes it difficult to study the effect of background variables. More research is needed to identify the active ingredients in the therapeutic approaches, as well as learning more about what methods to use with which children. How best to include family members in the follow-up of children is another area that needs more study. Regardless of the future advances in this field, the clinician has a variety of tools to choose from to help the individual child, be that in one-to-one therapy or in groups.

AB  - The rapid growth in the use of online technologies among youth provides an opportunity to increase access to evidence-based mental health resources. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of online mental health promotion and prevention interventions for youth aged 12–25 years. Searching a range of electronic databases, 28 studies conducted since 2000 were identified. Eight studies evaluating six mental health promotion interventions and 20 studies evaluating 15 prevention interventions were reviewed. The results from the mental health promotion interventions indicate that there is some evidence that skills-based interventions presented in a module-based format can have a significant impact on adolescent mental health, however, an insufficient number of studies limits this finding. The results from the online prevention interventions indicate the significant positive effect of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on adolescents’ and emerging adults’ anxiety and depression symptoms. The rates of non-completion were moderate to high across a number of studies. Implementation findings provide some evidence that participant face-to-face and/or web-based support was an important feature in terms of program completion and outcomes. Additional research examining factors affecting exposure, adherence and outcomes is required. The quality of evidence across the studies varied significantly, thus highlighting the need for more rigorous, higher quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of youth. Although future research is warranted, this study highlights the potential of online mental health promotion and prevention interventions in promoting youth wellbeing and reducing mental health problems.

AB  - Although exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious for childhood anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), many youth do not adequately respond to treatment. Extinction learning is an important process in exposure-based CBT. However, youth with anxiety disorders and OCD exhibit impairments in extinction processes that are best characterized by deficits in inhibitory learning. Therefore, the utilization of strategies to optimize inhibitory learning during exposures may compensate for these deficits, thereby maximizing extinction processes and producing more robust treatment outcomes for exposure-based CBT. This paper reviews several strategies to optimize inhibitory learning in youth with anxiety disorders and OCD, and presents practical examples for each strategy. This paper also highlights the difference between inhibitory learning-based exposures and prior conceptual approaches to exposure therapy in clinical practice. It concludes with a discussion of future directions for clinical research on inhibitory learning and exposure-based CBT in youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with Exposure/Response Prevention (ER/P) [CBT is the broader term and its subsequent use encompasses ERP.] has been shown to be effective in treating symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in pediatric and adult populations (Abramowitz, 1997; Abramowitz, Whiteside, & Deacon, 2005; Chambless & Hollon, 1998; The Pediatric OCD Treatment Study [POTS], 2004). According to the Expert Consensus Guidelines for children and adolescents with mild to moderate symptoms, CBT alone is recommended as the first line treatment and CBT plus medication for adolescents with severe symptoms (March, Frances, Carpenter, & Kahn, 1997). However, little information is known about actual treatments received by pediatric patients in the community and factors associated with treatment seeking. Considering onset of OCD symptoms typically occurs in adolescents (Kessler et al., 2005), without effective treatment symptoms can worsen over time (Eisen et al., 2006; Rapoport, Clary, Fayyad, & Endicott, 2005; Rasmussen & Tsuang, 1986). It was important to understand help-seeking behaviors in pediatric OCD and any other mediating variables that may predict access to quality treatment. This study examined the treatment history of pediatric OCD and potential factors that may predict treatment seeking once OCD symptoms become problematic. Eighty-three parents/caregivers of children with OCD participated. Regression analyses were used to examine relationships between SES, gender, age, parental anxiety, functional impairment, family accommodation, and symptom severity and the dependent variable of treatment latency. Child's gender was the only variable that demonstrated a significant relationship. Treatment latency was significantly longer for girls than for boys. A total of 14 different treatment variations were reported as received. The most common treatments included 27% receiving CBT alone, 16% for medication and CBT combined, and 13% for talk therapy alone. Medication treatment was reported as a primary component of all treatment providers, with psychiatrists utilizing medication the most. Within this vein, medication side effects were numerous with fluoxetine having a total of nine reported side effects. It appears that, although strides have been made with regards to dissemination of first line treatments, children continue to lack adequate access to CBT. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The results of a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of the treatment of generalized anxiety, separation anxiety and school phobia/refusal in children and adolescents are presented. Ten scientific reports appeared between 1980 and 2002, which fulfilled the selection criteria, were identified leading to 25 independent studies. Seven hundred and forty three children and adolescents, between the ages of 5 and 17 years, with a mean age of 11 and a gender proportion of 3 girls to 2 boys, took part. The 10-week treatment reached an overall medium-high effectiveness in the pos-test (d+ = 0.78) and a high effectiveness in an average ten-month follow-up (d+ = 1.06). With the exception of one study, the cognitive-behavioral therapy was applied, either on its own or together with family intervention or imipramine, and proved to be highly effective (d+ = 0.87). The components of the program proved to be highly effective especially contingency management (d+ = 1.53), relaxation (d+ = 1.29), exposure (d+ = 1.27), and self-instruction (d+ = 1.07). The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety disorders are common in children and adolescents with reported prevalence rates between 10% and 30%. A multimodal treatment approach is recommended for optimal outcome that comprises of psychotherapy (especially exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy), family and patient education, and use of medication if indicated. In patients who might benefit from use of medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drugs of choice. The safety and efficacy of medications other than SSRIs in the treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders are not fully established. Most children and adolescents respond well to treatment with long lasting resolution of symptoms, although, recurrence of the same, or development of a different type of anxiety disorder, is not uncommon. In most patients, anxiety disorders tend to persist into adulthood requiring long-term treatment planning. This chapter reviews the pharmacological agents used in the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were assessed (Social Responsiveness Scale-Parent (SRS-P); coded in-session behavior) in typically-developing, anxiety-disordered children (N = 50) treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Study 1: children with moderate autistic symptomology (per SRS-P) were significantly more likely to improve from family CBT (FCBT) than individual CBT (ICBT; OR = 8.67). Coded behavior did not predict outcome. Study 2: CBT components were compared by treatment and ASD symptom status. At-home exposure completion was greater in FCBT and there was an interaction in child involvement for treatment and ASD status. Though both treatments reduced anxiety, FCBT outperformed ICBT for children with moderate ASD symptoms, a benefit potentially linked to more at-home exposures and greater child involvement in FCBT.

AB  - Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by its similarity to anxiety disorders, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Family-based treatment (FBT) has shown promising initial results for treatment of AN in adolescents, yet the precise mechanisms of action are unknown. We present a theoretical argument and model, suggesting that FBT may work via exposure (and habituation) to food and its consumption. First, we review the evidence for pathological anxiety in AN, and suggest a framework for identifying specific anxious triggers, emotions (fear and worry) and avoidance strategies. Second, we briefly review evidence indicating that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and specifically exposure in its various forms is most effective for treating anxiety disorders in youth. Third, we consider distinct approaches to exposure therapy based on the pattern of triggers, anxious emotions and avoidance. We conclude that the interventions utilized in FBT share clear similarities to exposure with response prevention, a type of exposure therapy commonly used with OCD, and may work via facilitating habituation to food and eating in one’s natural environment. We also highlight how parents facilitate this process in between sessions by effectively coaching their children and facilitating naturalistic exposure to food and related triggers. Options for future research are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter highlights the role of cognitive behavior therapy or CBT with adolescents with anxiety symptoms as well as the need for involving their parents in the treatment process. Cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety symptoms/disorders in adolescents has proved its efficacy over other treatment modalities in various randomized control trials. CBT in over anxious adolescent involves psycho-educating them about nature of anxiety and teaching them skills to identify and manage their thoughts and emotions. It also involves reducing anxiety with the aid of relaxation exercises and exposure-based procedures. The most crucial aspect of CBT is its emphasis on learning through games, role-plays, and modeling. Also, since CBT is a time-limiting treatment modality, most individuals benefit in a relatively briefer time. Research proves that parents play a crucial role in not only maintenance of anxiety symptoms but also can become an aide in maintenance of treatment gains. Thus, it has been suggested that parents be involved in treatment as consultants, collaborators, or co-adolescents as required. The therapist may face certain barriers to treatment, but by involving the adolescent and family members in a collaborative framework right from the beginning, many of these barriers can be overcome.

AB  - This dissertation examined the long-term efficacy (8-to-13 years, M = 9.54, SD = 1.689) of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for phobic and anxiety disorders in youths. Long-term efficacy was examined in terms of diagnostic recovery, symptom reductions, and clinically significant change. This dissertation also examined predictors of long-term efficacy (e.g., age, gender, and other clinical characteristics) as well as the relative long-term efficacy of CBT for Hispanic/Latino and European American youth. Participants consisted of 67 youth (age range 15-26 years; M = 19.43, SD = 3.02 years at time of follow-up assessment), (47.8% females, 37.3% Hispanic/Latino) who had participated in one of two clinical trials (Silverman et al., 1999a, b). After providing informed consent to participate in the long term follow-up, youths completed a diagnostic interview and a battery of questionnaires. Results indicated that treatment gains were maintained about 9.5 years after treatment was completed. Maintenance of treatment gains was evident in terms of diagnostic recovery, symptom reductions, and clinically significant change. Long-term treatment gains extended to both ethnic groups and the two ethnic groups were functionally equivalent along most indices examined. Analyses of predictors of long-term outcome showed that parent self-reported pre-treatment depression, youth-reported pre-treatment depression, and youths retrospective reports of negative life events were significantly associated with less favorable long-term gains in terms of total symptoms of anxiety at long-term follow-up. In terms of long-term sequelae, youths with less successful post-treatment outcomes reported seeking-out additional treatment as well as using/abused substances and substance dependence significantly more than youths with successful post-treatment outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of the contribution of the present study to knowledge base about the long-term efficacy of exposure-based CBT procedures for phobic and anxiety disorders in youth. Findings also are discussed in terms of the need to modify CBT procedures to target youths with less successful post-treatment outcomes. Limitations and future directions are presented.

AB  - Anxiety disorders during pregnancy are highly prevalent and associated with serious and enduring consequences for both mother and child. Exposure-based cognitive behavioral (CBT) and behavioral therapies (BT) represent the most empirically supported psychosocial treatments for anxiety disorders in general adult samples. Pregnant women, however, generally have been excluded from this body of research. Evidence that pregnant women inhabit a unique biological context combined with untested assumptions that exposure would unduly stress or harm the fetus have likely prohibited inquiry. This paper seeks to remedy this gap by integrating findings from obstetric, psychiatric, and psychological research to inform central questions regarding exposure-based treatment of anxiety disorders during pregnancy. Based on available evidence, we consider the potential risks and benefits of CBT/BT for anxiety disorders during pregnancy relative to other currently available treatment options. From a multidisciplinary research perspective, we argue that exposure-based therapies are likely to be safe during pregnancy, particularly relative to the alternatives. However, we also highlight critical questions for future research to directly test the biopsychological impact of exposure-based therapies among pregnant women.

AB  - The cognitive-behavioral approach is used for a wide variety of disorders and problems such as mood disorders, marital and family problems, eating disorders, child behavior disorders, impulse-control disorders, and personality disorders and has produced a vast body of literature in the last three decades. In particular, numerous treatment outcome studies have generated a rich body of knowledge about the efficacy of variants of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. In this chapter, we limit our discussion to treatments that have amassed the strongest empirical support. We begin by reviewing what distinguishes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) from other psychotherapies, followed by a brief review of CBT's efficacy. We then present a general description of the cognitive-behavioral conceptualization of anxiety disorders. To this end, we discuss Foa and Kozak's (1986) emotional processing theory that explains the nature of pathological anxiety and the mechanisms of cognitive-behavioral treatments that are involved in ameliorating pathological anxiety. Next, because thorough assessment is a crucial first step in exposure-based interventions, we briefly review some of the evaluation techniques commonly used by cognitive-behavioral therapists to construct a plan that addresses the patient's core difficulties. Finally, we present detailed descriptions of two exposure therapy programs that have been developed and extensively studied at the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety (CTSA) at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia: 1) Exposure and Ritual Prevention (EX/RP) treatment program aimed at ameliorating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and 2) Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment aimed at reducing the severity of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Each type of treatment is illustrated by a detailed case example, and throughout the chapter, we present additional clinical examples of the interventions we describe. In addition, a video illustrates PE by portraying the treatment of a patient, 'Lisa,' with PTSD secondary to rape. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - It is our view that the bridging of research and practice is a prerequisite for the prosperous development of both research and clinical practice. Research on clinical conditions loses its goal when its attainments are not implemented in clinical practice, especially given that the rationale underlying clinical practice is to relieve the distress of children and families as much as possible. To us, 'as much as possible' is via empirically supported methods. We indicated that exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most empirically supported intervention and that the therapy 'works' using either an individual child approach, incorporating parents, the peer group, or both. We also indicated that these various approaches represent diverse pathways for a transfer of control (i.e., from therapist to child, from therapist to parent to child, from therapists to peer group to child). In addition, we discussed how a transfer-of-control model suggests potential mediators of positive child treatment response (e.g., in treatments incorporating the parent, improved parenting skills may facilitate child exposures, thereby leading to child anxiety reduction). Portions of the chapter subsequently discussed how transfer of control and its suggestive potential mediators provide suggestions about specific therapeutic procedures of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy that might be transported or adapted in clinic settings. The chapter also covered other features of research settings that might be transported or adapted to clinic settings and we showed how this was done in terms of our experiences in Miami (United States) and Leiden (Netherlands).

AB  - Four anxiety disordered 8- to 11-year-old children and their parents participated in a shortened version of an efficacious cognitive–behavioural program for anxiety in children, designed to reflect therapy conditions found in usual clinical practice. A modified multiple-baseline design was used that combined clinic setting pragmatics with a necessary level of methodological protection. For ongoing evaluation, weekly measures of the child’s trait anxiety and coping ability were obtained from the child and parents. In addition, a battery of measures was used to evaluate outcomes following treatment and at two follow-up intervals. Emphasising increased parent involvement and earlier exposure sessions, the program was found to lead to marked changes in child functioning. In particular, all children showed improvement on self-report, parent report, and independent clinician’s ratings over the course of treatment. Moreover, scores on relevant indices were all within a nondeviant range following intervention, and all four children no longer qualified for an anxiety diagnosis at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month followup. Findings are discussed in terms of implementation and evaluation in practice settings (e.g., critical components of treatment, use of pragmatic single case designs). Suggestions for future research include testing the effectiveness of this brief program on a large and diverse sample of children. Additional research is also required to find out to what extent increased parent involvement and earlier exposure sessions enhance the impact of treatment in the larger context of addressing features of the research-practice gap. Overall, findings provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of a brief cognitive–behavioural program for treating anxiety disorders in children, along with an evaluation strategy, compatible with some of the needs of service delivery settings.

AB  - Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), incorporating exposure and response prevention (ERP), has received strong empirical support for the treatment of paediatric OCD, and moreover, is considered the first line treatment of choice (Geller & March, 2012). However, despite the availability of effective treatments for this chronic and debilitating disorder, only a small proportion of youth receive these evidence-based approaches. The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of an intensive ERP-based treatment for youth OCD, using a multiple baseline controlled design. Children and youth (N = 10; aged 11–16 years) with a primary diagnosis of OCD were randomly assigned to a 1- or 2-week baseline monitoring condition followed by the intervention. The efficacy of the intensive treatment, involving 1 session psychoeducation, 2-sessions ERP plus e-therapy maintenance was examined across parent- child- and clinician-rated measures at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Overall, there were significant reductions across time on almost all measures (except self-report anxiety), and moreover, the majority of the sample (80%) were considered reliably improved, and meeting clinically significant change. At post-treatment, 60% were in remission of symptoms, and at 6-month follow-up this increased to 70%. These findings provide strong support for intensive, time-limited approaches to ERP-based CBT for children and youth with OCD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This pilot study tested the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on parent-reported autism symptoms. Nineteen children with autism spectrum disorders and an anxiety disorder (7–11 years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or a wait list condition. The CBT program emphasized in vivo exposure supported by parent training and school consultation to promote social communication and emotion regulation skills. Parents completed a standardized autism symptom checklist at baseline and posttreatment/ postwaitlist and 3-month follow-up assessments. CBT outperformed the wait list condition at posttreatment/postwaitlist on total parent-reported autism symptoms (Cohen’s d effect size = .77). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Further investigation of this intervention modality with larger samples and broader outcome measures appears to be indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) involves exaggerated or excessive worry about threatening and non-threatening stimuli coupled with impairing rituals believed to reduce anxiety. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairment in social and communicative activities as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Approximately 2% of children with ASD are also diagnosed with OCD. Although there is extensive research demonstrating the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for pediatric OCD, little is known about how effective these treatments are for children who have a dual diagnosis of OCD and ASD. This report describes a 12-year-old male with Autism who was treated successfully with cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention. This case study provides initial support that cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in symptom reduction for children with comorbid autism and OCD.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are common in adolescents (ages 12 to 18) and contribute to a range of impairments. There has been speculation that adolescents with anxiety are at risk for being treatment nonresponders. In this review, the authors examine the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescents with anxiety. Outcomes from mixed child and adolescent samples and from adolescent-only samples indicate that approximately two-thirds of youths respond favorably to CBT. CBT produces moderate to large effects and shows superiority over control/comparison conditions. The literature does not support differential outcomes by age: adolescents do not consistently manifest poorer out comes relative to children. Although extinction paradigms find prolonged fear extinction in adolescent samples, basic research does not fully align with the processes and goals of real-life exposure. Furthermore, CBT is flexible and allows for tailored application in adolescents, and it may be delivered in alternative formats (i.e., brief, computer/Internet, school-based, and transdiagnostic CBT).

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral theory and empirical support suggest that optimal activation of fear is a critical component for successful exposure treatment. Using this theory, we developed coding methodology for measuring CBT-specific process during exposure. We piloted this methodology in a sample of young children (N = 18) who previously received CBT as part of a randomized controlled trial. Results supported the preliminary reliability and predictive validity of coding variables with 12 weeks and 3 months treatment outcome data, generally showing results consistent with CBT theory. However, given our limited and restricted sample, additional testing is warranted. Measurement of CBT-specific process using this methodology may have implications for understanding mechanism of change in exposure-based treatments and for improving dissemination efforts through identification of therapist behaviors associated with improved outcome.

AB  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the evidence-based treatment of choice for childhood anxiety disorders. Its blend of cognitive and behavioral coping strategies for anxiety management has more empirical support than any other intervention approach. Yet even after receiving CBT, more than 40% of anxious children still meet criteria for their anxiety disorder. Research is needed to identify factors associated with treatment response and non-response, and ultimately to inform treatment improvement. Three studies, reflecting this broad objective, focus on factors that may relate to child treatment response---environmental, biological, and cognitive factors suggested by theoretical models of anxiety and potentially relevant to treatment effectiveness research. Study 1 examined whether parental anxiety is a negative predictor, and child perception of control a positive predictor, of treatment outcome in CBT within a randomized controlled trial for childhood anxiety disorders. We found that parental anxiety and child perception of control were not associated with treatment outcomes in the CBT or Usual Care treatment conditions with the exception of child perceived social control. In addition, parental anxiety levels did not change from pre- to post-treatment but child perceived control increased from pre- to post-treatment in response to both CBT and Usual Care. Study 2 examined biological stress response in the context of exposure, the treatment component widely regarded as the heart of CBT for anxiety. Analyses of salivary analytes focused on activation of biological systems implicated in the social stress response (i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system) in children with Social Anxiety Disorder and age-matched non-anxious controls, and we found that socially anxious children do not exhibit abnormally elevated biological reactivity. The study also tested whether heightened physiological arousal facilitates habituation and fear extinction, and we found that children who experienced greater biological activation over the course of a graduated exposure intervention appeared to benefit most. Finally, we found that subjective reports of heightened anxiety did not correspond to objective levels of biological arousal, suggesting that social anxiety may be associated with excessive self-monitoring and hypersensitivity to normative physiological response to stress and anxiety rather than biological dysregulation. Study 3 examined whether socially anxious children exhibit social skills deficits and/or negative cognitive appraisal biases in a social-evaluative speech task. We found that socially anxious children did not exhibit negative cognitive appraisal biases, but they did exhibit specific social skills deficits in comparison to age-matched non-anxious peers. Taken together, these studies shed light on child and parent characteristics that are positively and negatively associated with youth anxiety treatment outcome from a biopsychosocial perspective.

AB  - Each year millions of children are exposed to traumatic experiences. The body of literature related to children and their responses to disasters and trauma is growing. Mental health professionals are increasing their understanding about what factors are associated with increased risk (vulnerability) or decreased risk (resilience) for developing psychopathology after exposure to traumatic experiences. Most of the victims, children included, develop adaptation processes and react positively, both if they have been experiencing trauma directly or indirectly. There exists, however, a significant proportion of children who develop high levels of psychological distress after traumatic events, which interfere with child's social and family life and his/her developmental and learning processes. PTSD, anxiety and mood disorders, sleep disorders, conduct disorders, learning and attention disorders (ADHD) are the most common psychiatric problems following traumatic experiences, including physical injuries. In terms of providing treatment, CBT emerges as the best validated therapeutic approach for children and adolescents who experienced trauma-related symptoms, particularly symptoms associated with anxiety or mood disorders. Family support also may be necessary to help the family through this difficult period. Research on resilience in development reveals that extraordinary resilience and recovery power of children depend on basic human protective systems operating in their favour. This finding has produced a fundamental change in the framework for understanding and helping children at high risk or already in trouble. This shift is evident in a changing conceptualization of the goals of prevention and intervention that currently address competence and psychological well-being. This article reviews some strategies fostering resilience and describes the main characteristics and technical features of a novel psychotherapeutic strategy, Well-Being Therapy. This psychotherapeutic technique should be tested in future child psychiatry-controlled psychotherapy trials to verify its efficacy on children's protective factors.

AB  - Homework tasks are considered an integral component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for children. One of the primary objectives of CBT is to teach children specific skills with which to manage their emotional or behavioral difficulties more effectively. Initially, it is the role of the therapist to assist the child in learning and applying these skills. As therapy progresses, the child is increasingly asked (and is able) to use the skills without the assistance of the therapist. Gradually the responsibility is shifted from the therapist to the child. Practice of the skills is considered crucial to the learning process. Rehearsal both in and out of the session is likely to increase the child's opportunity for repeated practice and increase the likelihood that the child will master the skills. First, the practice occurs in the session, in a less threatening and more supportive environment. With increased confidence, out-of-session practice follows, allowing the child to implement new skills in problematic settings at school, at home, and with peers. Homework assignments allow the therapist to assess the child's grasp of the concepts. Homework gives the child an opportunity to demonstrate skill (without the guidance of the therapist) and allows the therapist to check the child's understanding of the material. Monitoring is particularly important when working with children. Although children may be overly compliant and eager to please and may agree with the therapist during the session without fully understanding the material, assessing and monitoring plays an important role in progress. There are a wide variety of CBT programs available for childhood disorders. Although in this chapter we cannot cover all of these programs, we will provide some as examples to illustrate selected points. Programs are available for parent training for children with oppositional behavior problems and for youth with anger problems and depressed mood. Other treatments have shown efficacy for anxious children, family anxiety management for anxiety in children, exposure for specific phobia, for childhood obesity, and for enuresis. Although the overall efficacy of these programs has been evaluated, the specific role that homework plays in determining outcome has yet to be evaluated. Examples of homework assignments from some of these programs are reviewed further on, but first we address the issues relating to homework that are not confined to a specific emotional or behavioral problem.

AB  - Background: Investigations of age effects on youth anxiety outcomes in randomized trials (RCTs) of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) have failed to yield a clear result due to inadequate statistical power and methodologic weaknesses. We conducted an individual patient data metaanalysis to address this gap. Question: Does age moderate CBT effect size, measured by a clinically and statistically significant interaction between age and CBT exposure? Methods: All English language RCTs of CBT for anxiety in 6–19 year olds were identified using systematic review methods. Investigators of eligible trials were invited to submit their individual patient data. The anxiety disorder interview schedule (ADIS) primary diagnosis severity score was the primary outcome. Age effects were investigated using multilevel modeling to account for study level data clustering and random effects. Results: Data from 17 of 23 eligible trials were obtained (74%); 16 studies and 1,171 (78%) cases were available for the analysis. No interaction between age and CBT exposure was found in a model containing age, sex, ADIS baseline severity score, and comorbid depression diagnosis (power ≥ 80%). Sensitivity analyses, including modeling age as both a categorical and continuous variable, revealed this result was robust. Conclusions: Adolescents who receive CBT in efficacy research studies show benefits comparable to younger children. However, CBT protocol modifications routinely carried out by expert trial therapists may explain these findings. Adolescent CBT protocols are needed to facilitate the transportability of efficacy research effects to usual care settings where therapists may have less opportunity for CBT training and expertise development.

AB  - Clinically elevated anxiety is a common, impairing feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A modular CBT program designed for preteens with ASD, Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA; Wood et al., 2009) was enhanced and modified to address the developmental needs of early adolescents with ASD and clinical anxiety. Thirty-three adolescents (11–15years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or an equivalent waitlist period. The CBT model emphasized exposure, challenging irrational beliefs, and behavioral supports provided by caregivers, as well as numerous ASD-specific treatment elements. Independent evaluators, parents, and adolescents rated symptom severity at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist. In intent-to-treat analyses, the CBT group outperformed the waitlist group on independent evaluators’ ratings of anxiety severity on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) and 79% of the CBT group met Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement scale criteria for positive treatment response at posttreatment, as compared to only 28.6% of the waitlist group. Group differences were not found for diagnostic remission or questionnaire measures of anxiety. However, parent-report data indicated that there was a positive treatment effect of CBT on autism symptom severity. The CBT manual under investigation, enhanced for early adolescents with ASD, yielded meaningful treatment effects on the primary outcome measure (PARS), although additional developmental modifications to the manual are likely warranted. Future studies examining this protocol relative to an active control are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety disorders among preschool-aged children are as prevalent as in older children, yet younger children are even less likely to receive treatment for these frequently impairing childhood disorders (Egger & Angold, 2006). Specific phobias (SPs) are often the earliest form of anxiety to onset, affect 2.3% of preschoolers (Egger & Angold, 2006), and tend to be stable from 3 years of age to at least 6 years of age (Bufferd, Dougherty, Carlson, Rose, & Klein, 2012). Recently, our group developed and piloted a modified intensive one-session treatment (OST) incorporating play therapy for preschoolers with SP (Farrell, Kershaw, & Ollendick, in press). Given that highly fearful young children may find concentrated, rapid exposure therapy highly confronting, we integrated play therapy into the commencement of this treatment to (a) assist with rapid rapport building with the therapist and (b) enhance the child’s motivation through engaging them with play. An initial, controlled, baseline case series (N = 4) provided preliminary evidence of the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of this innovative one-session (3 hours) therapy—POP! Pre-schoolers Overcoming Phobias (POP; Farrell et al., in press). The approach combines child-centered, nondirective play therapy (during Hour 1) and empirically supported OST (during Hours 2 and 3), with 4-year-old preschool children with clinical SPs of dogs. This article presents a case description of POP, describing the assessment approach, cognitive-behavioral case formulation, and intensive treatment of a 4-year-old girl who presented with a severe SP of dogs, along with various other comorbid SPs.

AB  - The present study’s aim was to examine the long-term effects (8 to 13 years post-treatment; M = 9.83 years; SD = 1.71) of the most widely used treatment approaches of exposure-based cognitive behavioral treatment for phobic and anxiety disorders in children and adolescents (i.e., group treatment and two variants of individual treatment). An additional aim was to compare the relative long-term efficacy of the treatment approaches. Method: At long-term follow-up, participants (N = 67) were between 16 and 26 years of age (M = 19.43 years, SD = 3.02). Primary outcome was the targeted anxiety disorder and targeted symptoms. Secondary outcomes were other disorders and symptoms not directly targeted in the treatments including (1) other anxiety disorders and symptoms, (2) depressive disorders and symptoms, and (3) substance use disorders and symptoms. Results: Long-term remission for anxiety disorders and symptoms targeted in the treatments was evident 8 to 13 years post-treatment. Long-term remission also was found for the secondary outcomes. There were more similarities than differences in the long-term gains when comparing the treatment approaches. Conclusions: Consistent with past research, the study’s findings provide further evidence that the short-term benefits of exposure-based CBT for childhood phobic and anxiety disorders using both group and individual treatment may extend into the critical transition years of young adulthood.

AB  - Maria was a 17-year-old Hispanic female who was referred to the clinician by her psychiatrist. She had been seeing the psychiatrist since the age of 13, primarily for medication management to help control her anxiety. Although taking a SSRI seemed to help decrease her anxiety a small amount, Maria had begun to compulsively pull her hair approximately six months before the intake, necessitating the referral. She was seen for 21 sessions of treatment, on roughly a weekly basis. This case demonstrates the difficulty in treating trichotillomania and how a flexible case conceptualization is needed to make progress efficiently. In traditional cognitive behavior therapy protocols for generalized anxiety disorder, relaxation tends to be taught first, followed by cognitive restructuring, and then exposure with response prevention. However, with Maria's strong avoidance and escape, which was actually causing therapy to stall because she would avoid her therapy homework, it was decided to engage in exposure with response prevention first. This 'flexibility within fidelity' model of CBT (using the strategies we know work, not in a lockstep fashion but in a way that makes most sense based on our case formulations) enhances delivery of services to our clients. This case also demonstrates that you cannot always count on a protocol going exactly as intended, as I needed to see Maria and her family for a number of sessions longer than originally planned.

AB  - This chapter discusses cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with adolescents. CBT is a problem-focused, time-oriented and evidence-based psychological intervention. It has been adapted to suit both children and adolescents as well. The therapist stance in CBT is one of collaborative empiricism, and this approach ensures that the adolescent feels that he/she is an active collaborator in therapy. The main focus in CBT for adolescents is the identification and modification of depressogenic or anxious thinking patterns and teaching skills in problem-solving, anxiety management and similar skills that will help the adolescent in dealing with challenging situations. Problem-solving skills and coping skills are effective for a variety of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents. In addition to core cognitive components such as cognitive restructuring, CBT also includes behavioral techniques such as relaxation training, exposure, role-play and activity scheduling. Parental involvement has been recommended in many formats of CBT for adolescents; however, care needs to be taken to inform the adolescent, and parental involvement must be defined clearly. Recent reviews support the effectiveness of CBT in adolescents; however, there is a need for long-term studies, with active treatment controls to further substantiate these conclusions. Future research must also focus on understanding how different mechanisms operate in CBT to bring about outcome. Studies must also focus on mediators and moderators of change in therapy. This can be made possible through dismantling studies. Psychological interventions based on the cognitive behavioral framework are effective in treating a wide variety of psychological problems seen in adolescents.

AB  - Over the past decade, multiple controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Relying heavily on behavioral exposure, cognitive restructuring, and psychoeducation, CBT for child anxiety has been shown to be adaptable to a variety of implementation formats, including individual, family, and group treatment. This article describes the conceptual framework underlying CBT and the key elements of this treatment approach. Important developmental and family considerations in treatment are discussed, and the empirical literature is reviewed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one of the most common mental disorders in the population. During the past two decades, an enormous amount of research has been conducted that has led to effective treatment strategies for this debilitating disorder. This book describes many of these techniques. We wrote this book with a number of readers and applications in mind. First and foremost, this book is designed for clinicians with basic knowledge in cognitive behavioral therapy who want to increase or establish their skills for treating SAD. In addition to the primary application of this book as a treatment guide, we have provided readers with a wealth of information on the nature of SAD and treatment efficacy as informed by controlled trials. Our purpose is to ensure that this book serves as a resource for clinical researchers as well as clinicians. In writing this book, we were also mindful of the various practice characteristics in which clinicians work. Our manual is designed for interventions that can be administered in individual treatments or in group settings, and accordingly, throughout the book we have provided examples of interventions in both of these formats. Group treatment brings with it the ease of having a ready-made audience available for social exposures. Yet, the formation of groups for treatment in a timely fashion requires a steady flow of patients with SAD. For practices without this flow, individual treatment will be the most efficient. Many exposure practices are conducted in vivo outside the therapist's office as part of what we call social mishap exposures. Some of the initial exposures happen ideally in the therapist's office. The use of clinic staff as an impromptu audience can aid clinicians in the application of individual treatment. These and other techniques outlined in this book are specifically geared toward the adult patient with SAD. Clinicians who would like to advance their understanding on SAD in children and adolescents may consult the books by Beidel and Turner (2007) and Albano and DiBartolo (2007). Overall, we hope our book will give a range of readers what they need to provide their patients with the best possible treatment that is currently available. We emphasize principle-guided treatment, complement this broad perspective with specific protocol with examples of interventions, and link all of these interventions to the wealth of guidance provided by the empirical literature. For clinicians, researchers, and students alike, we believe this approach will provide an accessible accounting of the treatment strategies important for individuals with SAD.

AB  - The common link among all cognitive-behavioral treatment strategies is that they are based on models of learning. Principles of classical conditioning, operant conditioning, cognitive learning theory, and social learning theory are the underpinnings of cognitive-behavioral strategies used to treat childhood anxiety. In this chapter, we highlight a number of studies that exemplify the application of behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy to the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. Applications of exposure-based strategies, contingency contracting, modeling, and cognitive procedures are illustrated, and an overview of Kendall and colleagues' (1992) integrated cognitive-behavioral treatment package is provided.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) have been shown to be efficacious for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Randomized clinical trials indicate that approximately two-thirds of children treated with CBT will be free of their primary diagnosis at posttreatment. Although several CBT treatment packages have been investigated in youth with diverse anxiety disorders, common core components have been identified. A comprehensive assessment, development of a good therapeutic relationship and working alliance, cognitive restructuring, repeated exposure with reduction of avoidance behavior, and skills training comprise the core procedures for the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth.

AB  - This therapist guide, and the companion workbook, addresses the treatment of shyness and social anxiety in children and adolescents. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the third-most-common mental disorder overall, and the most common anxiety disorder affecting adults, based on recent epidemiological studies. The disorder has been to shown to develop in early childhood or adolescence, and without treatment many youths will continue to exhibit symptoms into adulthood. Social anxiety has many adverse effects, including social impairment, negative self-concept, and higher rates of depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best available treatment for adults with social anxiety disorder. This program adapts CBT techniques for the treatment of youth in a group setting. It helps children and teenagers understand and control their social anxiety. The program teaches participants social and problem-solving skills, which are then tested with behavioral-exposure therapy. Group members are systematically confronted with feared or avoided social situations with strong therapeutic support to help them overcome their distress. This practical guide offers a complete group-treatment program for teenagers and children with social anxiety disorder, and for those suffering from debilitating shyness.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are often comorbid with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). There is empirical support to suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for comorbid anxiety disorders in youth with ASD. Modifications to CBT for youths with ASD have been made with emphasis on exposure being a critical component. Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of CBT on symptoms of depression in youths with ASD. Modifications to CBT will be outlined in this review, as will implementation suggestions for the clinician practicing CBT with ASD youth. Limitations of the studies investigating this intervention include small sample sizes, clinician- and parent-report of symptom change but not consistent self-identified change, limited validated tools for assessing change, and lack of long-term follow-up.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBTs) are widely used for anxiety disorders in typically developing children; however, there has been no previous attempt to administer CBT for specific phobia (in this case study, one-session treatment) to developmentally or intellectually disabled children. This case study integrates both cognitive-behavioral and behavior analytic assessment techniques in the CBT of water and height phobia in a 7-year-old male with developmental delays and severe behavior problems. One session treatment [Öst, L. G. (1989). One-session treatment for specific phobias. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 27, 1-7;Öst, L. G. (1997). Rapid treatment of specific phobias. In G. C. L. Davey (Ed.), Phobias: A handbook of theory, research, and treatment (pp. 227-247). New York: Wiley] was provided for water phobia and then 2 months later for height phobia. The massed exposure therapy sessions combined graduated in vivo exposure, participant modeling, cognitive challenges, reinforcement, and other techniques. Both indirect and direct observation measures were utilized to evaluate treatment efficacy. Results suggested CBT reduced or eliminated behavioral avoidance, specific phobia symptoms, and subjective fear. Negative vocalizations were reduced during height exposure following treatment. Vocalizations following treatment for water phobia were less clear and may have been indicative of typical 7-year-old protests during bath time. Findings indicate CBT can be effective for treating clinical fears in an individual with developmental disabilities and severe behavior. Future research in this population should examine CBT as an alternative to other techniques (e.g., forced exposure) for treating fears. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The goal of the current case study was to illustrate an evidence-based assessment and the cognitive-behavioral treatment of an 11-year-old male with emetophobia. A multimodal assessment of the child’s anxiety symptoms was conducted, including a semistructured diagnostic interview (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Child and Parent Versions), parent report (Behavior Assessment System for Children—Second Edition.), and child self-report (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and Child Depression Inventory). Emetophobia symptoms were assessed via parent and child report of the Emetophobia Questionnaire. Treatment included graduated exposure, cognitive restructuring, and parent training. Improvement was seen within 22 sessions and maintained at a 6 months follow-up. In addition to a reduction in symptoms of emetophobia, discontinuation of medication, and no longer meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria for specific phobia, treatment gains also included a reduction in internalizing and somatization symptoms as well as an increase in the patient's adaptive skills. This case study illustrates the use of CBT along with parent training as an efficacious treatment for children with emetophobia. It also demonstrates how to incorporate simple, everyday technology (i.e., Internet) to simulate exposures that are otherwise difficult to duplicate in the therapy session.

AB  - The present study describes the outcomes of a manualised treatment for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in female adolescents that combined traditional cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) with an interpersonal skills (IP) component. The CBT component included psychoeducation, somatic management, cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy and problem-solving. The IP component targeted interpersonal avoidance, passive and aggressive interpersonal styles, and co-rumination. Four female adolescents with a principal diagnosis of GAD participated in 10 weekly 1-hour sessions. Adolescent- and parent-report diagnostic interviews and questionnaires were completed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment, and at 3-months follow-up. Reductions in GAD and depressive symptoms and improvements in interpersonal functioning for all participants on both adolescent and parent-report measures suggest that the combination of CBT and IP can benefit adolescent girls with GAD.

AB  - A partial N-methyl-D-aspartate agonist, D-cycloserine, enhances fear extinction when given before or shortly after exposure to feared stimuli in animals. In this pilot double-blind placebo-controlled trial (trial number: ISRCTN70977225), 27 youth with obsessive–compulsive disorder were randomised to either 50mg D-cycloserine or placebo administered immediately after each of ten cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) sessions, primarily consisting of exposure and ritual prevention. Both groups improved significantly and maintained their gains at 1-year follow-up, with no significant advantage of D-cycloserine over placebo at any time point. The effects of CBT may not be augmented or accelerated when D-cycloserine is administered after sessions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Literature reviews presented in earlier chapters of this book and elsewhere (eg, Franklin & Foa, 2002) have already explicated that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are both efficacious treatments for OCD; yet at the same time, response to either of these monotherapies is neither universal nor complete. One can readily hypothesize an advantage for combined treatment by CBT plus SRI over either monotherapy alone, and prevailing belief in the veracity of this view is already reflected in the field in a number of different ways. Commenting on clinical practice with anxiety disorders more broadly Balon (2004, p. 63) states, 'A combination of proven pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies may be the most clinically prudent approach to the treatment of anxiety disorders.' Regarding OCD specifically, the OCD Expert Consensus Guidelines (March, Frances, Carpenter, & Kahn, 1997) recommended that for adults and adolescents with an initial Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; Goodman et al., 1989a, 1989b) score of 18 or higher, combined treatment should be considered the first-line option, along with SRI alone for adults (March et al., 1997). Some have advocated even more strongly for the relative advantages of combined treatment over monotherapies (eg, Greist, 1992; Greist & Baer, 2002). For example, on the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation's website there is a feature called 'How to Select a Behavior Therapist (http://www.ocfoundation.org/ocf-0003.htm),' written by Dr Michael Jenike, who states that, 'Over the last two decades, it has become increasingly clear that optimal treatment for most people with OCD involves the combination of medication plus the behavior therapy techniques of exposure and response prevention (EX/RP).' The purpose of this chapter is to consider whether initial treatment with CBT plus concomitant SRI should indeed be recommended for most OCD patients. In deliberating on this issue below, I have included discussion of practical, theoretical, and empirical factors, and conclude that the answer to this important question requires at least some qualification.

AB  - The present article uses meta-analysis to examine treatment components related to outcome within 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for childhood anxiety disorders (CADs) and eight RCTs for childhood obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Examination of the RCTs of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for CADs suggested that adding relaxation and delaying exposures until after the introduction of other anxiety management strategies does not increase the efficacy of exposure-based treatment. In addition, compared to the large effect size (ES) associated with exposure and response prevention (ERP) for OCD (k = 9, mean ES = 1.93), the effect size associated with CBT for CADs (k = 44, mean ES = 0.89) did not differentiate from attention placebo (k = 11, mean ES = 0.55), although it was more effective than waitlist control (k = 24, mean ES = 0.22). Instructively, ERP for OCD involved more exposure initiated earlier and less relaxation than CBT for CADs. In addition, RCTs of ERP were more likely to use clinician-administered measures as opposed to self-report and to be conducted in clinical versus recruited samples. These results suggest that dismantling studies using a gold-standard clinician-rated outcome measure to compare the value of adding anxiety management strategies to exposure will be necessary to increase the efficacy of CBT for CADs to levels achieved by ERP for OCD.

AB  - Following a historical précis regarding exposure and a brief description of a representative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for anxiety disorders in youth, we discuss several factors related to conducting exposure tasks in youth. Topics include assessing anxious situations, creating a hierarchy, and using imaginal, as well as in vivo and in- and out-of-session exposure tasks. We also describe and discuss the posture of the therapist with regard to the development and maintenance of rapport, the process of consulting with the child, the use of shaping and rewarding effort, the restraining from reinforcing avoidance, modeling for parents, and how to deal with the occasional less-than-successful exposure task. Developmental level of the child and contextual factors are examined as they might influence the design and implementation of exposure tasks. Last, we consider professional practice issues of liability, applications in private practice, and the challenges that face new therapists undertaking exposures. Examples and illustrations from actual clinical cases are included throughout. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on the articles by I. Lundkvist-Houndoumadi & M. Thastum (see record [rid]2013-24183-003[/rid]) & (see record [rid]2013-24183-004[/rid]). Two case studies by Lundkvist-Houndoumadi and Thastum (2013a, 2013b) describe the use of the Cool Kids cognitive behavioral therapy program for anxious children and their parents, which was conducted at their Clinic at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. In providing our reactions to these two fascinating and illuminating articles, we first familiarize readers with the Cool Kids program, including both its nature, range, and evidence base. This is followed by a discussion of some relevant issues and complications in doing therapy with anxious children that are illustrated by these case studies, including the motivation of both anxious children and their parents; the therapeutic role of exposure to anxious situations; a modular approach to accommodate individual variation; group versus individual format; directly addressing parental anxiety problems; and the cost-effectiveness of treatment.

AB  - Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is an evidence-based psychological treatment that can effectively ameliorate symptoms of depression and anxiety that are common responses to trauma exposure. However, access to high-quality mental health services can be problematic, especially for traditionally underserved populations such as rural/remote residents, racial/ethnic minorities, and those from low socioeconomic strata. Individuals living in remote areas encounter additional obstacles to care, including long travel distances to reach services, increased time out of work or school, lack of access to transportation, and childcare difficulties. Many rural/remote communities struggle with scarcity of resources in general, and specialized mental health resources specifically, which may inadvertently exclude patients from obtaining the most appropriate health care. Telemedicine, or the use of Internet-based video conferencing, allows a patient live and direct virtual access to specialized mental health care providers. This article examines the application of TF-CBT via telemedicine to treat trauma exposure in a teenager living in a rural setting. Though this case example originates in the rural southeastern United States, the barriers and concepts addressed are generalizable to other remote areas in the United States and worldwide. Specific attention is given to evidence-based treatments for trauma, the merits of the telemedicine modality, and confidentiality considerations when using Internet-based teleconferencing for the application of psychological services.

AB  - Comorbidity between panic disorder and major depression is found in the majority of individuals with panic disorder and a substantial minority of individuals with major depression. Comorbidity between panic disorder and depression is associated with substantially more severe symptoms of each of the disorders, greater persistence of each disorder, more frequent hospitalization and help-seeking behavior, more severe occupational impacts, and a significantly higher rate of suicide attempts. These two disorders share many risk factors, such as neuroticism, exposure to childhood abuse, informational processing biases, and elevated amygdala activation in response to negative facial expressions. Research on the temporal priority of panic disorder and major depression has most frequently found that panic attacks and other symptoms of anxiety predate the onset of the first major depressive episode, but the first depressive episode predates the onset of full panic disorder Treatment studies indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective treatment for panic disorder Other forms of treatment include medication, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Comorbid depression does not appear to affect the outcome of CBT for a principal diagnosis of panic disorder, and CBT for panic disorder has positive, yet limited, effects on symptoms of depression.

AB  - Therapist competence is an important component of treatment integrity. This article reports on the development and initial psychometric assessment of the Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Anxiety in Youth Competence Scale (CBAY-C), an observational instrument designed to capture therapist limited-domain competence (i.e., competence in the delivery of core interventions and delivery methods found in a specific psychosocial treatment program) in the delivery of the core practice elements in individual cognitive-behavioral treatment (ICBT) for youth anxiety. Treatment sessions (N = 744) from 68 youth participants (M age = 10.60 years, SD = 2.03; 82.3% Caucasian; 52.9% male) of the same ICBT program for youth anxiety from (a) an efficacy study and (b) an effectiveness study were independently scored by 4 coders using observational instruments designed to assess therapist competence, treatment adherence, treatment differentiation, alliance, and client involvement. Interrater reliability—intraclass correlation coefficients (2,2)—for the item scores averaged 0.69 (SD = 0.11). The CBAY-C item, scale, and subscale (Skills, Exposure) scores showed evidence of validity via associations with observational instruments of treatment adherence to ICBT for youth anxiety, theory-based domains (cognitive-behavioral treatment, psychodynamic, family, client centered), alliance, and client involvement. Important to note, although the CBAY-C scale, subscale, and item scores did overlap with a corresponding observational treatment adherence instrument independently rated by coders, the degree of overlap was moderate, indicating that the CBAY-C assesses a distinct component of treatment integrity. Applications of the instrument and future research directions discussed include the measurement of treatment integrity and testing integrity-outcome relations.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most frequent mental disorders in children and adolescents. They are also an important risk factor for psychological disturbances in adulthood and require adequate treatment. The effectiveness of psychotherapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders today can no longer be questioned. However, a meta-analysis of treatment studies shows that so far, only cognitive-behavior therapy has proved, on the basis of randomized, controlled trials (RCT), to be successful in the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Regardless of whether the cognitive behavior therapy took place individually or in a group, or whether it was carried out with the child alone or with the inclusion of the family, no differences in the effectiveness were found. The follow-up data show that the therapy success persisted for several years and that it was not limited only to the symptoms of anxiety. Although for many psychotherapeutic interventions there is still no empirical basis, initial RCT prove the short-term effectiveness of psychopharmacological treatment (SSRI). The central, empirically validated psychotherapeutic interventions include psychoeducation, cognitive treatment of dysfunctional thoughts, and systematic exposure to the situation triggering anxiety. These interventions will be presented briefly and open questions in psychotherapy research will be discussed in the conclusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Treatment outcome research has rarely allowed investigators to declare how or why therapeutic techniques work. As an initial step to understand such change processes, the current study investigated the timing of positive changes typically achieved during a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety reduction. Using an interaction element multiple baseline design across four children (N=4) diagnosed with selected anxiety disorders, anxiety levels, cognitive errors, and treatment outcome were repeatedly assessed as children progressed through four a priori determined treatment sequences. Results varied across reporters, dependent variables, and the order in which each treatment technique was delivered. Child-reported trends were slightly clearer than those reported by parents and suggested that exposure was a key element for triggering some (but not all) positive changes after completing self-monitoring and psychoeducation techniques.

AB  - Anxious children show attention biases towards and away from threat stimuli. Moreover, threat avoidance compared to vigilance predicts a poorer outcome from exposure-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), yet the mechanisms underlying this differential response are unclear. Pavlovian fear conditioning is a widely accepted theory to explain the acquisition and extinction of fear, including exposure-based treatments, such as CBT. In typical fear conditioning experiments, anxious children have shown larger physiological responses to an aversive unconditional stimulus (i.e., US on CS+ trials) and to non-reinforced stimuli (CS−) during fear acquisition and to both CSs during fear extinction compared to non-anxious peers. This study examined whether threat avoidance compared to threat vigilance was related to differences in fear acquisition and extinction in anxious children. Thirty-four clinically-anxious children completed a visual probe task including angry-neutral face pairs to determine the direction of threat attention bias as well as a discriminant conditioning and extinction task in which a geometric shape CS+ was paired with an aversive tone US, while the CS− geometric shape was always presented alone during acquisition trials. Both CSs were presented alone during extinction trials. Fear acquisition and extinction were indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR) and subjective measures. Children were classified as threat vigilant (N = 18) and threat avoidant (n = 16) based on the direction of threat attention bias on the visual probe task. During acquisition, threat avoidant relative to threat vigilant anxious children displayed larger orienting SCRs to both CSs during the first block of trials and larger third interval SCRs to the US on CS+ trials as well as on CS− trials. During extinction, threat avoidant anxious children showed delayed extinction of SCRs to both the CS+ and CS− and reported higher subjective anxiety ratings after extinction compared to threat vigilant anxious children. Threat avoidant anxious children may be more reactive physiologically to novel cues and to stimuli that become associated with threat and this may interfere with extinction learning. These findings could help explain previous evidence that threat avoidant anxious children do not respond as well as threat vigilant anxious children to exposure-based CBT.

AB  - Clinical studies in adults and children with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) have shown that D-cycloserine (DCS) can improve treatment response by enhancing fear extinction learning during exposure-based psychotherapy. Some have hypothesized that improved treatment response is a function of increased compliance and engagement in therapeutic homework tasks, a core component of behavioral treatment. The present study examined the relationship between DCS augmented cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) and homework compliance in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial with 30 youth with OCD. All children received 10 CBT sessions, the last seven of which included exposure and response prevention paired with DCS or placebo dosed 1 h before the session started. Results suggested that DCS augmented CBT did not predict improved homework compliance over the course of treatment, relative to the placebo augmented CBT group. However, when groups were collapsed, homework compliance was directly associated with treatment outcome. These findings suggest that while DCS may not increase homework compliance over time, more generally, homework compliance is an integral part of pediatric OCD treatment outcome.

AB  - Background: The need to establish an evidence base for early child disaster interventions has been long recognized. Objective: This paper presents a descriptive analysis of the empirical research on early disaster mental health interventions delivered to children within the first 3 months post event. Methods: Characteristics and findings of the included studies were summarized in frequency tables. The long-term effect of the interventions was evaluated using the findings at follow-up assessments. Results: Eleven empirical studies examining 16 interventions delivered to children within 3 months post disaster were identified for review. The studies included only four randomized controlled trials. The studies examined a range of intervention types (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, narrative exposure, meditation relaxation, debriefing, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) and reported positive effects for various outcomes including posttraumatic stress disorder caseness and posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, and functioning. Conclusions: Reflecting the difficulty mounting services and conducting research in the early post-disaster phase, this descriptive analysis of the research on early child disaster mental health interventions revealed a dearth of studies but also the successful implementation of a number of interventions.

AB  - Childhood obsessive-compulsive symptoms are being identified with greater prevalence than previously believed. Psychological treatment studies with this population have typically included children older than seven, used cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and response-prevention, and involved the child's family in some capacity. Studies, however, have largely ignored children under seven, have used cognitive techniques, despite evidence to suggest that they may not be appropriate or necessary for children under the age of nine, and have infrequently delineated a systematic role for the family in treatment. Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT; Brinkmeyer & Eyberg, 2003) is an empirically validated behavior management intervention, originally designed to treat oppositional children through systematic parental involvement, but was adapted to incorporate treatment for young children with obsessive-compulsive symptoms. PCIT has preliminary evidence in treating separation anxiety when tailored to include graduated exposure to feared separation situations as a separate phase of treatment. An exposure and response-prevention-based modification of PCIT was implemented to treat three boys ages four to eight who presented with compulsive behaviors. For this eight-week, 12-session study, a single-subject repeated measures, within-subject design was utilized. Pre- and posttreatment compulsive behavior was measured at the child's home using coded observations of reassurance-seeking, avoidance, and ritualizing. Baseline assessment of in-session child compulsive behavior and parent behavior occurred over three monitoring sessions at the university clinic and continued throughout treatment by both standardized and modified versions of the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-Third Edition (Eyberg, Nelson, Duke, & Boggs, 2005), a behavioral observation and coding system used in PCIT to continuously measure changes in child behavior and parental mastery of PCIT skills. There were eight treatment and teaching sessions, four of which involved strategies to improve parent-child relationships and four sessions of parent-led exposure and response-prevention. Observable decreases were noted for child compulsive behaviors and for maladaptive parent behaviors. Parents also demonstrated observable increases from baseline of adaptive behaviors. Due to the age of the children recruited, criteria for inclusion included the presence of compulsive behaviors, such as compulsive counting, rather than a mandatory diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD); although, this treatment has implications for said OCD population.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of anxiety reduction on academic engagement for eight students experiencing significant anxiety in grades three through five. All participating students showed high anxiety levels that appeared to be impacting performance on at least one academic task in the classroom, according to teacher report. Student participants received a modified cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the form of five 20-minute sessions, in the school setting. Also as part of treatment participants completed exposure tasks, which involved the child participating in anxiety provoking academic tasks, with adult support. To assess whether or not anxiety was reduced, participants completed Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) ratings several times weekly and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) both pre- and post-treatment. The Direct Behavior Rating (DBR) was used to monitor students’ academic engagement and was completed by the teacher. Results of this study show that this intervention, conducted in the school setting, has promising outcomes. The findings provide initial support that a modified anxiety treatment with adult support can be effective in reducing anxiety and increasing academic engagement.

AB  - We compared the effects of a 16-week Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program and a Social Recreational (SR) program on anxiety in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Seventy children (9–16 years old) were randomly assigned to either of the programs (nCBT = 36; nSR = 34). Measures on child’s anxiety using the Spence Child Anxiety Scale—Child (SCAS-C) and the Clinical Global Impression—Severity scale (CGI-S) were administered at pre-, post-treatment, and follow-ups (3- and 6-month). Children in both programs showed significantly lower levels of generalized anxiety and total anxiety symptoms at 6-month follow-up on SCAS-C. Clinician ratings on the CGI-S demonstrated an increase in the percentage of participants rated as ‘‘Normal’’ and ‘‘Borderline’’ for both programs. Findings from the present study suggest factors such as regular sessions in a structured setting, consistent therapists, social exposure and the use of autism-friendly strategies are important components of an effective framework in the management of anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy of mothers Obsessive-Compulsive symptom on their children’s behavioural disorders. One of the fifth educational districts of Isfahan and two elementary schools of this district were randomly selected. Then all mothers of the student’s in grades one and two, were asked to complete the Moudzly Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, (MOCI), the Nilipour Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (NOCI) and the Ontario Child Health Scale (OCHS). The results of Pearson correlation showed that there was a correlation of 0.54 between mother’s obsession and her child behaviour disorder. This correlation was significant at the level of 0.01 (2-tailed). In the second step 40 mothers with the highest MOCI score were diagnostically interviewed. As a result, 32 mothers received the diagnosis of OCD. Then the subjects were randomly divided into two experimental and control groups. The Moudzly Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, Nilipour Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory and Ontario Child Health Scale scores were used as pre-test. The 8 cognitive-behavior therapy sessions of 90 minutes including parenting methods, 'perfectionism' a cause of anxiety, relaxation, logical errors, challenge with thoughts, and exposure and response prevention (E/R P) were conducted during one month on the experimental group. The control group received no intervention. The same tests were administered to both groups as post-test. One month later, same scales were administered as followed-up. Due to losing two members in the experimental group, two members of the control group were randomly deleted . The results of analysis of covariance showed that symptoms of maternal OCD in the experimental group were significantly reduced in comparison to the control group in the post-test and follow-up phases (p < 0.0001). The mean score of child behaviour disorder decreased significantly in comparison to the control group in the follow-up phase (p = 0.001); but not in post-test phase (p = 0.204).

AB  - Anxiety disorders are widespread among children. Separation anxiety, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder show overlapping symptoms, which is why interventions often seek to treat all three disorders together. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been proven in various meta-analyses to be the most effective in treating anxiety disorders. Beside psychoeducation, relaxation, cognitive techniques, and exposure, working with parents of affected children is common. However, the methods of working with parents differ widely among interventions. Next to psychoeducation, parents are taught to support exposures themselves and parental anxiety is addressed in several interventions. The present review examines whether working with parents increases the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for anxiety disorders among children. In a systematic research, 25 studies were found where parents were involved in the treatment of their children, ranging from just a few sessions with the parents to interventions where only the parents were coached. While 13 studies focused on working with children, 12 studies focused on the parents in the therapeutic interventions, aiming to treat children’s anxiety by increasing parental competence in dealing with anxiety. It has been shown that cognitive behavioral therapy is generally superior in regard to remission of anxiety disorders compared with a wait control group. Interventions that include working with the parents are not more effective than interventions focusing solely on the children. Increasing the number of sessions with the parents does not increase the effectiveness of the interventions. This result is surprising because it contradicts the experience gained in therapeutic practice. However, the lack of increase in effectiveness by working with the parents is in conformity with previous studies. The differential effectiveness of specific modules of interventions has not been sufficiently explored. The studies analyzed in this review mostly comprised patients of widely differing age as well as patients with various anxiety disorders. This methodology complicates making a statement on the effectiveness of various modules, since it has been shown that cognitive behavioral therapy has different effects for different anxiety disorders. It is currently under discussion whether additional sessions with parents at the expense of further exposure – proven to be highly effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders – are useful. Despite the results of this review, treatment of anxiety disorders in children without working with parents could not be imagined. Particularly in the case of younger children and specific anxiety disorders, working with parents is necessary. The limitations of this review as well as possible implications for working with parents are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Social anxiety disorder, or social phobia (SP), is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear of exposure to situations that involve potential scrutiny by others. SP is a common psychiatric problem in children and adolescents, often presenting with comorbid anxiety and mood disorders. Although the onset of SP is typically in late childhood or early adolescence, most afflicted individuals go undiagnosed for years, not seeking treatment until adulthood. First-line treatments for SP in adults support the use of pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. There is new and emerging data in youths with SP to support the use of similar treatments. This paper will review the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and treatment of SP in youths. Current investigations using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibors, benzodiazepines, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors in youths will be reviewed. Several studies on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy in youths will also be examined. Practical guidelines for clinicians who treat children and adolescents are also presented.

AB  - This process-outcome psychotherapy study examined the influence of emotional arousal and habituation on symptom reduction in two brief therapies for adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Although affect regulation and emotional processing have been long regarded as essential markers of therapeutic progress in healing from trauma, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical investigation of affective process variables contributing to good therapeutic outcome. This study explored the relationship of observer-rated emotional arousal and habituation to PTSD symptom reduction in 46 adult female survivors of CSA: 21 in a 14-session cognitive-behavioral exposure therapy (CBT), and 25 in a 14-session supportive present-centered therapy (PCT). Researchers rated from videotapes clients' peak and modal negative affective arousal, and the presence/absence of eight categorical emotions (e.g. fear, sadness, anger, shame) across an early and late session. Six hypotheses investigated whether extremes of overly restricted or unmodulated emotional arousal and reduced rates of between-session habituation were significantly related to poorer treatment outcome, and whether this relationship changed depending on the type of treatment. Participants who experienced more habituation of negative affect arousal (expressions of distress manifest in facial expressions, voice intonation, and body language) exhibited more PTSD symptom (e.g. nightmares, intrusive memories, avoidance of triggers) improvement. Higher peak arousal and lower modal arousal at the beginning of therapy were related to more symptom reduction. Although overall negative affect arousal was higher among CBT clients than PCT clients, this interaction did not relate to improvement on PTSD symptomatology. The data did not show support for any correlations between observer-rated negative affect arousal and clients' subjective report of distress, or for any relationship between expression of categorical emotions and symptom improvement. Finally, no association was found for the therapy group by habituation interaction in predicting PTSD symptom reduction. These findings provide support for the centrality of emotional engagement and habituation in treating PTSD, and highlight the need to develop more empirically supported ways of assessing constructs related to emotional processing and regulation. For clinicians, monitoring and helping regulate clients' emotional arousal in PTSD therapies is crucial for achieving good outcome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this chapter, we focus specifically on engaging adolescents in treatment for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) because their particular developmental stage and emerging needs for autonomy may affect the therapeutic alliance and their willingness to engage in what can be anxiety-provoking and arduous treatment. Before discussing six important strategies for enhancing adolescent engagement in treatment, we briefly review general information about OCD in youth and components of cognitive–behavioral treatment for pediatric OCD. Although how and when the techniques are presented vary by manual cognitive–behavioral approaches for youth with OCD tend to have five general components. These are some form of (a) psychoeducation; (b) creation of an OCD stimulus hierarchy; (c) cognitive techniques, anxiety management techniques, or both; (d) exposure plus response prevention; and (e) family or parental involvement. The six engagement strategies are (a) assessment as engagement, (b) psychoeducation as engagement, (c) focusing on the whole adolescent, (d) role clarification of family members, (e) therapist style, and (f) collaboration in development and pace of hierarchy.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this research project is to investigate the effects of cognitive-behavioral group therapy on adolescents suffering from symptoms of social anxiety. Method: cognitive behavioral group therapy program for reducing social anxiety was developed by the authors, after which a pilot study was conducted, evaluated for deficiencies, finalized, and implemented in the following study. The final program entailed 13 sessions covering relaxation training, cognitive restructuring and exposure components. To recruit the participants for the intervention program screening tests were applied to 711 students of three different junior high schools in Izmir. 44 students (treatment=24, control= 20) who met the inclusion criteria in the seventh and eighth grades participated in the main study. Evaluation of the therapy program was ascertained using the following instruments; for students, Negative Cognitive Errors Questionnaire (CNCEQ), Cape Social Phobia Scale for Children and Adolescents (CSPSCA), Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A); and for parents, (SAS-P) was used to compare their pre-program and post-program tests results. Results: Repeated measures ANOVAs yielded significant Group X Time interactions for SAS-A (F (1, 42) =7.511, p< 0.01, η² =0.15), CSPSCA (F (1, 42) =6.54, p<.05) and CNCEQ (F (1, 42) = 8.295, p<0.01, η² =0.16) scores. Results from parents further indicated that social anxiety in the treatment group had decreased after program completion (F (1, 42) = 9.496, p=0.004, η² =0.18). Conclusion: Consistent with the literature of school based Cognitive-Behavioral Group Treatment (CBGT) programs for social anxiety, it was found that adolescents in the treatment group exhibited a significant decrease in social anxiety and related cognitive errors.

AB  - Background: Extinction is a key theoretical model of exposure‐based treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This study examined whether individual differences in physiological responses and subjective stimulus evaluations as indices of fear extinction predicted response to CBT. Methods: Thirty‐two nonanxious comparisons and 44 anxious, 7‐to‐13‐year‐old children completed a Pavlovian conditioning and extinction task. Anxious children then completed group‐based CBT. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) as well as subjective arousal and valence evaluations were measured in response to a conditioned stimulus paired with an aversive tone (CS+) and another conditioned stimulus presented alone (CS−). Both stimuli were presented alone during extinction. Diagnostic and symptom measures were completed before and after treatment. Results: Like nonanxious comparisons, treatment responders did not acquire conditioned negative stimulus evaluations and displayed elevated SCRs that declined significantly across extinction trials. Nonresponders, by contrast, showed elevated negative stimulus evaluations of both CSs that were sensitive to extinction trials but showed no change in SCRs during extinction. Change in physiological but not evaluative indices of fear extinction predicted better treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Individual differences in evaluative and physiological indices of fear extinction might moderate response to CBT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on the article by E. Sobanski and M. H. Schmidt (see record [rid]2000-13397-010[/rid]) which describes the case of a 16-yr-old female with body dysmorphic disorder who was successfully treated with a standard program of behavior therapy, namely exposure and response prevention, in combination with doxepine. Veale suggests that this behavior therapy may be less successful in those patients who are more concerned with an internal aversion toward their appearance as opposed to an external fear of negative evaluation of others. Such patients may require a more cognitive approach, with the identification of their core beliefs about their appearance and the use of rational role-plays and behavioral experiments. No data exists on whether cognitive-behavioral therapy and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor enhance efficacy, especially when there is a comorbid depression, but this is the best current pragmatic approach.

AB  - Child and adolescent trauma exposure is prevalent, with trauma exposure-related symptoms, including posttraumatic stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms often causing substantial impairment. This article updates the evidence base on psychosocial treatments for child and adolescent trauma exposure completed for this journal by Silverman et al. (2008). For this review, we focus on 37 studies conducted during the seven years since the last review. Treatments are grouped by overall treatment family (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy), treatment modality (e.g., individual vs. group), and treatment participants (e.g., child only vs. child and parent). All studies were evaluated for methodological rigor according to Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology evidence-based treatment evaluation criteria (Southam-Gerow & Prinstein, 2014), with cumulative designations for level of support for each treatment family. Individual CBT with parent involvement, individual CBT, and group CBT were deemed well-established; group CBT with parent involvement and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) were deemed probably efficacious; individual integrated therapy for complex trauma and group mind–body skills were deemed possibly efficacious; individual client-centered play therapy, individual mind–body skills, and individual psychoanalysis were deemed experimental; and group creative expressive + CBT was deemed questionable efficacy. Advances in the evidence base, with comparisons to the state of the science at the time of the Silverman et al. (2008) review, are discussed. Finally, we present dissemination and implementation challenges and areas for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Specific phobias are among the most common anxiety disorders, especially in children. Unfortunately, a paucity of literature exists regarding the treatment of specific phobia in young children, despite the knowledge that traditional techniques (i.e., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) may not be practical. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present two case studies that provide empirical support for the evidence-based behavioral treatment of specific phobia with young children (ages 4 and 5 years). Results indicated that following 10 to 13 sessions of graduated exposure therapy using reinforced practice and participant modeling, the children no longer met criteria for clinically significant phobias of dogs. Treatment effects were maintained at 7-month follow-up despite reported lack of practice and/or regular exposure to dogs in the children’s daily lives.

AB  - This chapter provides an introduction to specific phobias, their etiology, and a brief overview of three evidence-based treatment approaches: cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), one-session treatment (OST) as a variant of CBT, and systematic desensitization. Overlapping themes in these treatment approaches include thorough evidence-based assessment, building a fear hierarchy, gradual exposure, cognitive challenges, and homework. Clinical judgment should inform which treatment approach will be the most effective for the child or the adolescent. Factors to consider should include cognitive developmental level (i.e., younger children may benefit from a more behavioral emphasis than cognitive) and family schedule (i.e., whether weekly sessions or a 3-hour intensive is more feasible). Working to overcome fears may enhance the overall quality of life for the child, adolescent, and their families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental disorders in the general population, as well as specifically presenting to primary care facilities. Primary care physicians are in a unique position, as they are often the first line of defense in the treatment of anxiety disorders. These physicians are faced with the daily challenge of diagnosing and treating patients with anxiety conditions, either as the primary complaint, the underlying reason for their somatic symptoms, or in addition to their medical condition. Children and the elderly often present with somatic complaints, such as stomach aches or headaches and chronic pain or insomnia, respectively. The general adult population may also present with anxiety as a primary complaint, requesting pharmacological interventions and being unaware of other treatment options. Generally, physicians do treat anxious patients with medication, although clinical practice guidelines recommend to also treat anxiety disorders with psychotherapy interventions to include: psychoeducation, relaxation techniques, exposure and systematic desensitization, EMDR, and CBT. Pharmacotherapy for all ages includes first-line medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and second-line serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Children, adolescents, and the elderly do have unique characteristics rendering certain medications better than others and more specific risk-factors that primary care providers must consider when prescribing anti-anxiety medications.

AB  - This is a systematic review of evidence-based treatments for children exposed to childhood maltreatment. Because exposure to childhood maltreatment has been associated with a broad range of trauma-related psychopathology (e.g., PTSD, anxiety, suicidal ideation, substance abuse) and with aggressive and violent behavior, this review describes psychotherapeutic treatments which focus on former broad range of psychopathological outcomes. A total of 26 randomized controlled clinical trials and seven non-randomized controlled clinical trials published between 2000 and 2012 satisfied the inclusionary criteria and were included. These studies dealt with various kinds of samples, from sexually abused and maltreated children in child psychiatric outpatient clinics or in foster care to traumatized incarcerated boys. A total of 27 studies evaluated psychotherapeutic treatments which used trauma-focused cognitive, behavioral or cognitive-behavioral techniques; only two studies evaluated trauma-specific treatments for children and adolescents with comorbid aggressive or violent behavior; and four studies evaluated psychotherapeutic treatments that predominantly focused on other mental health problems than PTSD and used non-trauma focused cognitive, behavioral or cognitive-behavioral techniques. The results of this review suggest that trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is the best-supported treatment for children following childhood maltreatment. However, in line with increased interest in the diagnosis of complex PTSD and given the likely relationship between childhood maltreatment and aggressive and violent behavior, the authors suggest that clinical practice should address a phase-oriented approach. This review concludes with a discussion of future research directions and limitations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined treatment response and maintenance to exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for Hispanic/Latino relative to European-American youths with phobic and anxiety disorders. A total of 131 Hispanic/Latino and European-American youths (aged 6-16 yrs) who participated in 2 previous clinical trials for phobic and anxiety disorders were compared along diagnostic recovery rates, clinically significant improvement, and youth- and parent-completed questionnaire scores using traditional hypothesis tests, including effect sizes, and statistical equivalence tests. Results show that after treatment, Hispanic/Latino and European-American youths responded similarly to exposure-based CBT in their diagnostic recovery rates and questionnaires. Effect sizes for questionnaire data were also more similar than different across the 2 groups. With regard to treatment maintenance, Hispanic/Latino and European- American youths also responded more similarly than differently, albeit with some variations within specific assessment points in questionnaire data. The authors conclude that exposure-based CBT for phobic and anxiety disorders produced positive treatment gains and maintenance for Hispanic/Latino youths who participated in the trials.

AB  - The current study examines factors related to use of exposure therapy by clinicians who treat children with anxiety disorders. A sample of 331 therapists from a variety of backgrounds (i.e., social workers, doctoral psychologists, masters level counselors, and marriage and family therapists) completed a survey regarding use of exposure and other treatment techniques for childhood anxiety disorders, as well as beliefs about exposure and child resiliency. Although the majority of therapists endorsed a CBT orientation (81%) and use of CBT techniques, exposure therapy was rarely endorsed. Holding a PhD in psychology as well as more positive beliefs about exposure and child resiliency were associated with greater use of exposure. The results suggest that exposure-based therapy is rarely offered in community settings and that dissemination should focus on individual evidence-based principles and correcting therapist misconceptions.

AB  - Objective: This study compared family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; the Building Confidence Program) with traditional child-focused CBT with minimal family involvement for children with anxiety disorders. Method: Forty clinically anxious youth (6-13 years old) were randomly assigned to a family- or child-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Conditions were matched for therapist contact time. Both interventions included coping skills training and in vivo exposure, but the family CBT intervention also included parent communication training. Independent evaluator, parent, and child report measures with demonstrated validity and reliability were used to assess child anxiety symptom outcomes at pre- and posttreatment. The data analytic strategy involved an evaluable patient analysis. Results: Compared with child-focused CBT, family CBT was associated with greater improvement on independent evaluators' ratings and parent reports of child anxiety--but not children's self-reports--at posttreatment. Conclusions: Both treatment groups showed improvement on all outcome measures, but family CBT may provide additional benefit over and above child-focused CBT. These findings provide preliminary support for the efficacy of the 'Building Confidence' program and encourage further research in parental participation in treatment for childhood anxiety.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure/response prevention is effective among youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and comorbid anxiety symptoms. This case illustrates the application of a modularized family-based CBT approach with a school-aged boy with autistic disorder and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Following 16 family sessions over 21 weeks, 'Jerry,' a 9-year-old Caucasian male, showed significant reduction in obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Jerry’s parents also reported improvements in emotional regulation, participation in school activities, and in his parent–child relationships. This case study illustrates the use of family-based CBT, which has been modified to account for social and behavioral deficits endemic to ASDs, for school-aged youth with autism and comorbid OCD.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric conditions, affecting as many as 1 in 10 individuals. The diagnosis of anxiety disorders peak during adolescence, a period characterized by pronounced changes in the ability to regulate emotional thoughts and behavior. These changes occur in parallel with development of frontolimbic circuitry captured by the 'imbalance model' of adolescence. Clarifying the nature of neurobehavioral changes during this developmental phase may provide important insight into both the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the only evidence-based behavioral treatment for anxiety disorders. Yet 40% to 50% of patients do not improve with this treatment, underscoring the need to predict who will respond to this treatment. A primary therapeutic component of CBT involves exposure exercises in which a patient is systemically desensitized to anxiety triggers through repeated exposures. Desensitization is based on principles of classical fear learning and extinction. Recent advances in our understanding of the development of fear extinction provide reason to investigate whether exposure therapy is best suited for all age groups.

AB  - Fear conditioning and extinction are central in the cognitive behavioral model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which underlies exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Youth with OCD may have impairments in conditioning and extinction that carries treatment implications. The present study examined these processes using a differential conditioning paradigm. Forty-one youth (19 OCD, 22 community controls) and their parents completed a battery of clinical interviews, rating scales, and a differential conditioning task. Skin conductance response (SCR) served as the primary dependent measure across all three phases of the conditioning procedure (habituation, acquisition, and extinction). During habituation, no meaningful differences were observed between groups. During acquisition, differential fear conditioning was identified across groups evidenced by larger SCRs to the CS+ compared to CS-, with no significant group differences. During extinction, a three-way interaction and follow-up tests revealed youth with OCD failed to exhibit differential fear conditioning during early fear extinction; whereas community controls consistently exhibited differential fear conditioning throughout extinction. Across participants, the number and frequency of OCD symptoms was positively associated with fear acquisition and negatively associated with fear extinction to the conditioned stimulus. OCD symptom severity was negatively associated with differential SCR in early extinction. Youth with OCD exhibit a different pattern of fear extinction relative to community controls that may be accounted for by impaired inhibitory learning in early fear extinction. Findings suggest the potential benefit of augmentative retraining interventions prior to CBT. Therapeutic approaches to utilize inhibitory-learning principles and/or engage developmentally appropriate brain regions during exposures may serve to maximize CBT outcomes.

AB  - Background: Fear acquisition and extinction are central constructs in the cognitive‐behavioral model of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), which underlies exposure‐based cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT). Youth with OCD may have impairments in fear acquisition and extinction that carry treatment implications. We examined these processes using a differential conditioning procedure. Methods: Forty‐one youth (19 OCD, 22 community comparisons) completed a battery of clinical interviews, rating scales, and a differential conditioning task that included habituation, acquisition, and extinction phases. Skin conductance response (SCR) served as the primary dependent measure. Results: During habituation, no difference between groups was observed. During acquisition, differential fear conditioning was observed across participants as evidenced by larger SCRs to the CS+ compared to CS−; there were no between‐group differences. Across participants, the number and frequency of OCD symptoms and anxiety severity was associated with greater reactivity to stimuli during acquisition. During extinction, a three‐way interaction and follow‐up tests revealed that youth with OCD showed a different pattern of SCR extinction compared to the community comparison group. Conclusions: Youth with OCD exhibit a different pattern of fear extinction relative to community comparisons. This may be attributed to impaired inhibitory learning and contingency awareness in extinction. Findings suggest the potential benefit of utilizing inhibitory‐learning principles in CBT for youth with OCD, and/or augmentative retraining interventions prior to CBT to reduce threat bias and improve contingency detection.

AB  - Anxiety and depression have been found to be highly comorbid and among the most commonly diagnosed disorders in youth. Research indicates that these disorders are generally left untreated, which increases risk for greater impairment and a longer course of psychological dysfunction. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in treating youth internalizing problems, but most treatment manuals have focused on a single disorder. Transdiagnostic treatments, which focus on commonalities among disorders, may be more relevant to treating internalizing problems than standard treatment manuals. In particular, Behavioral Activation, which has been found to be a key ingredient in the treatment of depression, shows promise as a transdiagnostic treatment because of its parallel goals with exposure-based therapies for anxiety. Implementing these treatments in a school-based setting may serve to reduce the barriers to treatment and increase the number of youth receiving services for internalizing disorders. Before a treatment can be implemented in a school, a variety of acceptability and feasibility issues must first be assessed. The focus of the current study was to obtain feedback from a range of potential providers on the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a group behavioral activation treatment (GBAT), known as the SKILLS Program, in middle schools with children who have elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression. Eighteen professionals participated in the current study. Overall ratings indicated highly positive impressions of the therapist manual and workbook, and all subscales related to acceptability received close to maximum ratings. Feasibility ratings were routinely lower, indicating that respondents found that the time allotted for tasks may have been less than desirable and that some of the assigned tasks may have been challenging to accomplish in school settings. However, ratings were still above the midpoint rating, suggesting that respondents found the program overall feasible. Despite potential challenges, individual professionals felt positive about the implementation potential of GBAT. Discussion focuses on implications of study findings, potential ways to increase feasibility, further examination of open-ended feedback, as well as limitations of the study and suggestions for future research.

AB  - The subject of the paper is the presentation of simple phobias, with particular attention to those connected with natural environment, their classification according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV systems, current views on aetiology and pathogenesis of phobic fear, as well as treatment methods. Among pathogenic factors of simple phobia, genetic predisposition, harmful environmental factors in early childhood and intrapsychic conflicts have been considered. In the paper, the results of neuroimaging studies in phobic patients were also presented as well as evolutionary aspects leading to persisting predisposition to phobic traits in the population. Epidemiologic studies point to a marked prevalence of simple phobias. Psychotherapy is regarded a basic treatment method for simple phobias: in-vivo exposure and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been proved effective. The case report of a hospitalized patient with wind phobia (ancraophobia) supplements the theoretical part. Clinical observation allowed for a detailed identification of symptoms of the disorder and selection of pharmacological treatment complementary to psychotherapy. A substantial improvement has been obtained in the patient described after combination treatment with psychoanalytic therapy and paroxetine, 20 mg per day.

AB  - This study assessed the effectiveness of a combined individual and group cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) program to reduce music performance anxiety (MPA) in adolescent musicians. Twenty-three adolescents with high MPA from a selective high school were randomly assigned to either a seven-session intervention program or a behaviour-exposure-only control group. The intervention consisted of psychoeducation, goal setting, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training and behavioural exposure in the form of two solo performances with audience. Outcome measures included self-reports of MPA, trait and state anxiety, diagnostic interview for social phobia, heart rate, frontalis EMG, and performance quality. Significant improvements in self-reported MPA were observed at posttest for adherent students only (i.e., students who were actively engaged in the program and who adopted program techniques). Adherent students also had higher MPA at commencement. Non-adherent and behaviour-exposure-only students both showed reductions in MPA over the study period but not to the same degree as adherent students. There appeared to be no effect of CBT on performance quality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety is highly prevalent in the community, and despite improvements in therapy a significant proportion of people tend to relapse, or remain significantly symptomatic. Theorists have proposed that untreated attachment anxieties and separation conflicts emerge from childhood development to be pervasive problems in adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the influence of juvenile and concurrent adult separation anxiety on psychotherapy outcomes. It was hypothesised that separation anxiety impedes therapy progress. A sample of 154 adults with a DSM-IV anxiety disorder received eight weekly sessions of group cognitive-behaviour therapy. In addition to intake and termination measures of anxiety and depression, participants also completed measures of juvenile and adult separation anxiety and the influence of these on outcomes was studied. Higher adult separation anxiety was associated with a greater likelihood of anxiety and comorbid depression remaining unremitted at termination of treatment. Higher juvenile separation anxiety was only associated with a greater likelihood of still being comorbidly depressed at termination of treatment. The findings of this study highlight the need to modify conventional exposure-based CBT treatments, and provide psychodynamic treatments that address attachment anxieties and separation conflicts.

AB  - Child and Adolescent Trauma Treatments and Services Consortium (CATS) was created in the aftermath of the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks to make high-quality evidence-based (EB) treatment available to the most highly affected children and adolescents throughout New York City and adjacent Long Island. The aims of the consortium were to use EB assessments to identify children and adolescents affected by 9/11 or other traumas; to provide age-appropriate EB treatments and services to youths with moderate to severe traumatic symptoms; to rigorously examine with a common cross-site evaluation protocol clinical outcomes for children including trauma exposure, depression, anxiety, and behavior problems and the relationship of these outcomes to receipt of trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT); and to identify key contextual factors that affected delivery of these services and predicted clinical improvement. The CATS Consortium successfully created an infrastructure across 9 provider organizations and 45 sites. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter focuses on treatment for the three main youth anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD). The results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) support the utility of child-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating anxious children and adolescents. The chapter also describes the incorporation of play-related activities in one structured version of CBT for youth anxiety known as the Coping Cat. The Coping Cat program provides a therapist manual. The Coping Cat, as CBT, is a synthesis of behavioral and cognitive strategies, with social and emotional aspects included. The Coping Cat program includes several components that have been considered to be active treatment ingredients. The inclusion of play and fun activities provides an age-appropriate method of treatment delivery. The Coping Cat program provides a series of related and sequenced skills for anxiety management. This program also involves both imaginal and in vivo exposure tasks. The purpose of exposure tasks is to create a level of anxious arousal for the child in a supportive environment. The treatment of anxiety in youth using the Coping Cat program encourages a flexible approach to manual-based treatment for anxiety disorder in children and adolescents.

AB  - This clinical case study investigated the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention for a child with autism and anxiety-related problem behavior that integrated components of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with positive behavior support (PBS). One child with autism and his family participated. The dependent variable was the number of steps that the child completed in an anxiety hierarchy during exposure sessions in one or more shopping malls. A changing criterion design evaluated improvements in child behavior. The design had three phases: implementation with interventionists, maintenance and generalization with family, and follow-up. Direct observation results during implementation with interventionists documented stepwise improvement in child behavior consistent with the steps in the anxiety hierarchy. Parent verbal report during the maintenance and generalization phase indicated that the child’s ability to ride on escalators maintained and generalized. Follow-up data collected 24 months post intervention indicated continued success. Results are discussed in terms of limitations, implications, and future research.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the application and integration of family systems therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of symptomatic children with histories of sexual abuse. This is achieved via the case of Ryan, a 12-yr-old boy who had been sexually abused by 2 family members and who was experiencing affective/anxiety symptoms and acting-out behavior problems (for case presentation, see record [rid]2002-01096-013[/rid]). While this paper provides a theoretical rationale and comprehensive treatment plan, additional details of specific treatment interventions, from both treatment modalities, are delineated. From the family systems perspective, an emphasis is placed upon the discussion of realignment of family structure and changing familial communication patterns (including messages about safety, protection, and validation of children's experiences). From the cognitive behavioral paradigm, exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring are accentuated. Finally, the importance of the integration of both modalities without violating the theoretical assumptions of either is highlighted. In addition, Ryan's presenting problems, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) diagnosis, assessment plan, and case conceptualization are briefly discussed.

AB  - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common childhood psychiatric condition associated with significant psychosocial impairment. Fortunately, recent treatment advances have identified two evidence- based treatments: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). CBT for pediatric OCD is based on the notion that obsessions and compulsions are functionally related and consists of three interrelated core components: (a) exposure (placing the patient in situations that elicit anxiety related to their obsessions); (b) response prevention and (c) teaching objective thinking strategies. The National Institute of Health translational research road map emphasizes clinical testing to provide effective services for the general public. Intensive treatment addresses this need by providing a condensed treatment package suitable fot those who do not have local access to CBT and for those who are refractory. Notably, services are provided without undue 14-week disruption in their lives, thus removing a roadblock to empirically supported treatment.

AB  - Background: Anorexia nervosa exhibits high comorbidity rates and shared features with anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety-based etiological models have proposed that fear of eating-related stimuli is the central mechanism around which avoidance of food and foodrelated rituals are performed. Building on this approach, exposure-based interventions have demonstrated promising results. Limited evidence in adolescents encourages the evaluation of exposure approaches in this population. Method: The current study presents a preliminary evaluation, in eight adolescents with anorexia nervosa, of an exposure-based CBT featuring an intensive format and parental involvement. Results: significant improvements in physical and psychological outcomes were observed. Conclusions: this case series provides preliminary support for the efficacy of intensive family exposure-based CBT for treating adolescents with severe anorexia nervosa.

AB  - Antecedentes: la anorexia nerviosa presenta una alta comorbilidad y características compartidas con los trastornos de ansiedad y el trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo. Los modelos etiológicos centrados en la ansiedad han propuesto que el miedo a los estímulos relacionados con la alimentación es el mecanismo principal por el cual se llevan a cabo la evitación de la comida y los rituales relacionados con la alimentación. Basándose en este enfoque las intervenciones centradas en las técnicas de exposición han demostrado resultados prometedores. La escasa evidencia en adolescentes motiva la evaluación de los enfoques basados en la exposición en esta población. Método: en el presente estudio se llevó a cabo una evaluación preliminar de la TCC con exposición en formato intensivo e inclusión familiar, en ocho adolescentes con anorexia nerviosa. Resultados: se observaron mejoras signifi cativas en las medidas de resultado físicas y psicológicas. Conclusiones: el presente estudio de serie de casos proporciona evidencia preliminar de la efi cacia de la TCC intensiva familiar con exposición para adolescentes con anorexia nerviosa severa.

AB  - The aim of this article is to inspire uses of cognitive behavioural therapy in school psychological settings. Based on a case story, the author describes the problems of diagnosing school phobia and the use of cognitive therapeutic principles in the treatment of school phobia. The diagnosis was made with the International Classification of Diseases-10 system. The methods used in the treatment were: the marking of anxiety levels, restructuring irrational thoughts, a hierarchy of anxiety, exposure in vivo based on shaping, counter-contingency, and positive reinforcement. The therapy lasted 11 months, and the results were that the total school absence of the child was reduced to zero after 7 month. Evaluations after half a year and one year showed nil absence due to anxiety or school phobic symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by thoughts that cause fear (obsessions or intrusive thoughts) and/or behaviour or mental rituals performed in order to reduce fear or to avoid terrible consequences (compulsions). Obsessive thoughts usually cause compulsive actions. OCD usually occurs between early adolescence and early adulthood; however, it appears in childhood as well. The aim of this article was to present the basis of understanding, conceptualization, techniques and evaluation in the cognitive-behavioural approach through the description of psychotherapeutic treatment of a girl with OCD. This case study describes an 11-year-old girl who was in psychotherapy treatment for a year and a half. The goals of psychotherapy treatment were to educate the girl and her mother about OCD, encourage more adequate coping with obsessive thoughts, delay or cancel the compulsions and improve daily functioning by increasing the number of situations with which the girl was faced. Applied techniques included a range of behavioural and cognitive interventions with the purpose of gradual exposure and cognitive restructuring, with particular emphasis on the four-step method. Cognitive-behavioural therapy achieved better daily functioning in all areas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Opsesivno-kompulzivni poremećaj (OKP) je anksiozni poremećaj karakteriziran mislima koje izazivaju strah (opsesije ili prisilne misli) i/ili ponašanja ili mentalne predodžbe koje osoba radi kako bi smanjila strah ili izbjegla strašnu posljedicu (kompulzije). Opsesivne misli obično izazivaju kompulzivne radnje. OKP se obično javlja između rane adolescencije i rane odrasle dobi, ali može se pojaviti i u djetinjstvu. Cilj ovog rada jest prikazom psihoterapijskog tretmana djevojčice s OKP-om iznijeti osnovu razumijevanja, konceptualizacije, primjene tehnika i evaluacije u kognitivno-bihevioralnom pristupu. Opisana je 11-godišnja djevojčica koja je u psihoterapijskom tretmanu bila godinu i pol. Ciljevi psihoterapijskog tretmana bili su educirati djevojčicu i njezinu majku o OKP-u, adekvatnijem suočavanju s opsesivnim mislima, odgađanjem ili odustajanjem od prisilnih radnji, poboljšati svakodnevno funkcioniranje povećanjem broja situacija s kojima se suočava. Primijenjene tehnike uključivale su niz bihevioralnih i kognitivnih intervencija usmjerenih na postupno izlaganje i kognitivno restrukturiranje s posebnim naglaskom na metodu 4 koraka.

AB  - The successful application of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and other anxiety problems is arguably one of the greatest recent success stories in psychotherapy research and practice. Several large clinical trials, multiple meta-analyses, and several effectiveness studies have shown variations of CBT to be effective for treating OCD in both children and adults. Unfortunately, there is also evidence that many individuals who receive the recommended 'dose' of CBT experience significant and problematic residual symptoms and relapse after treatment. So it is important that we also make efforts to improve treatment engagement, response, and maintenance. This timely series brought together leading authorities on CBT for OCD to begin to explore whether a better understanding of how exposure-based techniques are incorporated into treatment might provide valuable insights into how to improve outcomes.

AB  - This therapist guide, and the companion workbook for patients (see record [rid]2008-05010-000[/rid]), addresses the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia in adolescents. The onset of the disorder often occurs in adolescence and, left untreated, panic symptoms can continue into adulthood. Adolescence is a time of significant developmental growth, and therefore the impact of the disorder can be severe. Panic disorder and agoraphobia can interfere with school attendance, social functioning, and autonomous development. It has also been associated with higher rates of depression. This guide uses a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach based on the well-established MAP treatment program for adults. It has been specifically developed and tested for use with adolescents ages 12-17. Through psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and exposure techniques, adolescents learn about the nature of anxiety and panic and how to face their fears. An optional parent component involves parents in each session; handouts provide them with tips for parenting their anxious teen. The guide also offers suggestions on adapting the material for younger patients and for intensive treatment. For therapists working with the adolescent population, this guide is a unique and valuable resource. It offers a proven and effective treatment that helps therapists work with adolescents to overcome their avoidance and deal with their panic.

AB  - The evidence base for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat child emotional and behavioral symptoms following exposure to trauma in youth is compelling, but relatively few studies are available on preschool children and on moderators of treatment outcomes. This paper examines maternal and child characteristics as moderators of posttraumatic stress (PTS) treatment outcomes in preschool children. Outcome data from a previously published randomized trial in three to six year old preschool children with diagnostic interview data from participating mothers were used. Hypotheses were tested via hierarchical linear modeling. Maternal depression was associated with higher initial child posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and was associated with increasing PTSD symptom trends at follow up suggesting potential child PTSD symptom relapse. Maternal PTSD symptoms similarly predicted differential child separation anxiety symptom change but not child PTSD symptom change. Targeting dyads with child PTSD symptoms and maternal depression or PTSD symptoms with enhanced interventions may be a useful strategy to improve treatment maintenance.

AB  - Objective: Given that childhood anxiety disorders are common and frequently undertreated, novel treatment platforms are needed. The current article explores the potential for mobile device-based (m-health) applications, to expand access to evidence-based treatment. Methods: This article reviews the relevant literature regarding barriers to disseminating evidence-based treatment, the potential benefits of the m-health platform, standards for evaluating m-health interventions, and currently available applications. Results: Although a large number of m-health applications for anxiety are available, the vast majority of them are inconsistent with therapy protocols supported by the child anxiety treatment literature. The relatively few m-health applications based on evidence-based practice have not yet been examined empirically. Conclusions: Realizing the potential of m-health for child anxiety will require addressing the uncertainty around the necessary and sufficient components of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as the common challenges associated with delivering interventions via information and communication technology. Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach is an m-health application designed by the author and colleagues to be consistent with exposure-based CBT and principles for effective intervention delivery via information and communication technology. Recommendations for identifying, using, and developing m-health applications for childhood anxiety disorders are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Social phobia is a debilitating anxiety disorder that often goes undetected in young children, but can be effectively treated with cognitive-behavioral interventions. For children and adolescents, treatment usually includes education, social skills training, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training, and exposure. However, for very young children who present with social phobia, it is necessary to adapt treatment to the developmental level of the child. A case illustration demonstrates the way in which cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) was modified for the treatment of a five year-old girl with social phobia. Several modifications were made, including utilizing novel exposure techniques and emphasizing parent management training in order to promote generalization of treatment gains outside of session.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be broadly conceived as the integration of cognitive and behavioral approaches for making specific targeted changes in thoughts, feelings, or behaviors (Craske, 2010; see also Scarpa & Lorenzi, Chapter 1, this volume, for a description of CBT history, principles, and its application to children and adolescents). The therapeutic approach of CBT is to encourage the person to be more consciously aware of his or her emotional state, to learn to respond more appropriately and effectively to the situation or emotion, and to become more sensitive to how others are feeling. Much of the early work in cognitive therapy focused primarily on adults with depression (e.g.. Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; Ellis, 1962). Since then, however, the incorporation of cognitive with behavioral techniques has been extended to numerous problems, such as anxiety, marital difficulties, substance abuse, eating disorders, attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and many others. Moreover CBT has been extended downward to work with children and adolescents and is generally thought to be effective if appropriate developmental considerations and modifications are put into place (e.g., parent involvement, use of visuals, incorporation of play; Grave & Blissett, 2004; Ollendick, Grills, & King, 2001). Typically, because of the focus on measurable change, CBT programs begin with an assessment of the nature and degree of problems associated with specific emotions or behaviors, using self-report scales and a clinical interview. After an adequate assessment of the problem, multiple strategies may be implemented to promote change, including psychoeducation, somatic management via relaxation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, exposure therapy, and relapse prevention (Velting, Setzer, & Albano, 2004). Finally, to address cognitive biases, cognitive restructuring may be used to correct distorted conceptualizations and dysfunctional beliefs, and to constructively manage emotions. Then, therapist and client may plan a schedule of activities for practicing these new cognitive skills to comprehend and express emotions in real-life situations. In line with the focus of this book, this chapter refers primarily to working with children and adolescents with ASD who are verbal and cognitively higher functioning. It seems plausible, however, that CBT can also be used with nonverbal people with ASD who have the cognitive capability and a functional communication system that the therapist can use (however, we are aware of no research on this issue). CBT can be implemented in a one-on-one (therapist and child) or group format. Whether the CBT is conducted on an individual or a group basis, there need to be adjustments to the therapy to accommodate the interpersonal and social abilities of the person(s) with ASD, including the explanation of the social conventions and protocol expected in the individual or group social situation. Finally, there needs to be consideration of the sensory profile of the person with an ASD in terms of sensory sensitivity (auditory, olfactory and tactile) to aspects of the therapy environment. Some of the issues to consider in adapting a CBT program are specific to ASD, whereas others may be more generally applicable but especially pertinent to working with someone with ASD. This chapter explores each of these modifications to a conventional CBT program and provides practical advice on other characteristics associated with ASD that can inhibit or enhance the effectiveness of CBT for such children and adolescents.

AB  - Recent data have emerged suggesting the benefits of a modular rather than manualized approach to treating anxiety disorders, particularly in school settings. However, little is known about the use of specific modules or their relation to treatment process or response. Using data from a modular cognitive behavioral treatment for anxiety disorders delivered by school clinicians, this study examined (a) the frequency of module use (e.g., exposure, cognitive restructuring), (b) whether therapy session process variables (e.g., therapeutic relationship) varied by module, and (c) the relation between specific module use and treatment response. Data from 124 therapy sessions were used to address these questions. Therapy sessions were delivered by 11 school-based clinicians to a sample of 16 volunteer youth (mean age 11.1 years; 68.8 % female, 87.5 % African-American) as part of a randomized controlled trial (Ginsburg et al. in Child Youth Care Forum 41:1–19, 2011). After each therapy session, clinicians identified the module used and rated various process variables. Treatment response was assessed by blind evaluators who conducted diagnostic interviews with children and parents post-intervention and at a 1-month follow-up. The most frequently used modules were exposure (47 % of sessions), psychoeducation (20 % of sessions), and cognitive restructuring (18 % of sessions). Session process variables (e.g., child involvement, therapeutic relationship) varied by module. No individual module predicted treatment response. Findings suggest that newly trained clinicians do not use CBT modules with equal frequency and type of module does not appear to affect key treatment variables. Future studies are needed to explore the reasons clinicians select specific modules as well as the quality of implementation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Selective mutism (SM), a debilitating disorder usually appearing in childhood, is diagnosed when an individual capable of speaking fails to speak in social situations in which there is an expectation for the individual to speak. There is very little empirical research on the assessment and treatment of SM in adolescents and adults. The case presented in this article applies a developmental adaptation of a modular cognitive-behavioral therapy approach to treat an adolescent female with SM and social phobia. The treatment consisted of 61 sessions, including sessions on psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, exposure, social skills, and parent training. The presenting symptoms, assessment strategy, and treatment elements are covered in detail. The client’s symptoms were assessed via fear hierarchy ratings, self-report and parent-report measures, and client and parent clinical interviews.

AB  - Anxiety Coach is a smartphone application ('app') for iOS devices that is billed as a self-help program for anxiety in youth and adults. The app is currently available in the iTunes store for a one-time fee of $4.99. Anxiety Coach is organized around three related content areas: (a) self-monitoring of anxiety symptoms, (b) learning about anxiety and its treatment, and (c) guiding users through the development of a fear hierarchy and completion of exposure tasks. Although the app includes psychoeducation about anxiety as well as information regarding specific skills individuals can use to cope with anxiety (e.g., cognitive restructuring), the primary focus of the app is on exposure tasks. As such, the app includes a large library of potential exposure tasks that are relevant to treating common fears and worries, making Anxiety Coach useful to clients and clinicians alike. Additionally, Anxiety Coach prompts users to provide fear ratings while they are carrying out an exposure task and displays a message instructing users to stop the exposure once fear ratings drop by half. These features work together to create an app that has the potential to greatly increase the reach of exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety.

AB  - A number of studies provide evidence supporting computer-based interventions for use in the treatment of psychological disorders in adults and preliminary data are emerging on the feasibility of the modality with children. Internet- and/or computer-based treatments have great potential for the dissemination of evidence-based practice and offer a promising new area of investigation in the field of child anxiety research. The emergence of health care management organizations and the development of treatment standardization procedures are providing a fresh impetus to address this problem. Computer-based approaches may be particularly beneficial for the treatment of anxiety because they can present both still and video images of feared stimuli in hierarchies, ranging from simple drawings to video clips, and offer a medium by which exposure to feared situations can occur in a controlled manner. Taken as a whole, the extant literature supports the efficacy of CBT for social anxiety disorder, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder in youth and the feasibility of a computer-based CBT program. We believe that although questions remain, and further work is needed, these programs have the potential to have a meaningful impact on the dissemination of evidence-based treatments-particularly for anxiety disorders in youth.

AB  - Discusses the impact and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents. The most common obsessions in both children and adults with OCD are related to a fear of dirt and contamination, fear of some terrible happening, and the fear of harming a loved one. The most common compulsions are washing fixations, checking behavior and rituals. It is estimated that up to 2% of children and adolescents have symptoms fulfilling OCD criteria. Long-term studies show that around 50% of these patients will also suffer from OCD in adulthood. These patients tend to remain socially isolated, to have fewer relationships than their non-OCD peers, and have a tendency to remain within the family home during early adulthood. In addition, childhood OCD is associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders, in particular depression, anxiety and panic disorders, Tourette's syndrome and eating disorders. Treatment strategies for childhood OCD reflect those used in adult psychiatry. The most effective psychotherapeutic approach is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and prevention. In contrast to pharmacotherapeutic agents without serotonin activity, the serotonin-specific antidepressants appear to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of OCD in children.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) is an anxiety disorder that usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood, but may begin in childhood. When OCD starts in childhood, it is more common in boys than in girls. The usual time of onset is later for females than males, so the disorder is equally common among adult men and women. Without treatment, OCD usually follows a chronic course, and some persons become severely disabled by it. The exact cause of OCD is not known. There is evidence that OCD can run in families and may have a genetic (inherited) component. Treatments for OCD include drug therapy; cognitive behavioral therapy; exposure and response prevention.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth most common psychiatric disorder in the United States, affecting about 6-9 million or about 3% of US children. While OCD can be a debilitating disorder, evidence-based treatment such as Cognitive- Behavior Therapy (CBT) using Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) has been found to be effective at reducing symptom severity and distress caused by anxiety. ERP has been established as a particularly efficacious treatment, with metaanalyses demonstrating that 60%-80% of individuals experience significant reduction in symptoms. Research also suggests that treatment gains derived from ERP often are maintained at a 2-year follow-up. ERP is considered a short-term therapeutic intervention, and symptom improvement is usually seen within 12-15 sessions. Despite the effectiveness of CBT, the majority of youth with OCD do not receive these first-line treatments and as a result they experience impairments in functioning (CBT). Several barriers to treatment contribute to the discrepancy between the large number of youth with OCD and the small number who actually receive efficacious treatment. Most saliently, these include a lack of knowledge of treatment options; logistical complications associated with treatment access; the limited number of trained OCD providers; and fear, distrust, or unfamiliarity with accessing psychiatric, medical, or behavioral health services. Without receiving effective treatment, children often struggle at school and experience impairments in their academic functioning. With the goal of helping support children with OCD at school, this chapter first covers ways to overcome treatment barriers. Second, school-based service delivery is discussed to help inform clinicians how they can work effectively with school-based professionals. Additionally, content on relevant laws that influence school-based delivery is covered as well as how these laws can be utilized. Lastly, seven specific recommendations on how clinicians can help with children with OCD at school are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Given the high rates of comorbid anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the adolescent and young adult population, effective treatment protocols to address anxiety symptoms are of importance to help promote greater independence across settings. While research supports the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) across younger age groups with ASD, the literature is limited on interventions benefitting adolescents and young adults with comorbid anxiety disorders and ASD. Therefore, this open trial utilized a modified CBT manual for seven participants between the ages of 16 and 20 years, consisting of a 16-week modularized CBT treatment, including psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, and exposure therapy. Measures of anxiety and depression were completed at baseline and post-treatment. Findings demonstrated significant reductions on clinician-rated measures of anxiety. While findings are encouraging, additional studies examining the efficacy of CBT for this population with ASD and clinical anxiety are necessary to further identify beneficial treatment components.

AB  - Inhibition of fear generalization with new learning is an important process in treatments for anxiety disorders. Generalization of maladaptive cognitions related to traumatic experiences (overgeneralized beliefs) have been demonstrated to be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adult populations, whereas more balanced, accommodated beliefs are associated with symptom improvement. It is not yet clear whether (a) overgeneralization and accommodation are associated with PTSD treatment outcome in youth, or (b whether accommodated beliefs can interact with or inhibit cognitive overgeneralization, as has been demonstrated in research on behavior-based fear generalization. The current study examined the relationships between overgeneralized and accommodated beliefs, child age, and symptom reduction in a sample of 81 youth (age 7–17 years), who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Overgeneralized and accommodated beliefs expressed during the exposure phase of treatment were coded in audio-recorded therapy sessions. Overgeneralization predicted (a) higher internalizing symptom scores at posttreatment, particularly for younger children, and less improvement over treatment, and (b) higher externalizing scores at 1-year follow-up and steeper symptom increases over this period. In contrast, accommodation was associated with (a) lower posttreatment internalizing symptoms and greater improvement over treatment, and (b) lower externalizing scores at 1-year follow-up, particularly for younger children. High levels of accommodation moderated the relationship between overgeneralization and worse symptom outcomes, except when predicting the slope of internalizing scores over treatment, and age did not moderate these effects. There were no significant predictors of child-reported PTSD-specific symptoms, although PTSD symptoms did decrease significantly over the course of treatment and maintain 1year after treatment.

AB  - Panic disorder (PD) is a not uncommon phenomenon in adolescents, although it is underreported and undertreated. Beitman et al. (1990) and Rosenbaum (1987) first described a condition in adults who met DSM-III-R criteria for PD but lacked any subjective fear or anxiety. They termed it 'non-fearful panic disorder' (NFPD). In our practice, we evaluated and treated an adolescent with what we believe represents an instance of NFPD. A 17-year-old male, Greg, was first evaluated with the chief complaint of school avoidance for the previous 2 years. He started both the ninth and tenth grades with a positive attitude, but on the second day of each school year, he became ill in the morning with the following symptoms: headache, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, stomach churning, derealization, tightness in his chest, and a lump in his throat. It was decided that Greg should begin a course of individual cognitive-behavioral therapy. He regularly attended a total of 15 sessions with an emphasis on monitoring symptoms, somatic control strategies, cognitive restructuring, and exposure. Following the initiation of these interventions, the frequency and duration of school attendance improved. Greg continued to deny subjective feelings of anxiety or worry, yet reported increased control and management of his physiological symptoms, which diminished to subclinical levels. Although he completed the school year, he was unable to return the following year and is again on home study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Discusses the potential roles of parents in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with anxious youth and how parents can both facilitate and/or impede treatment progress. Parents facilitate the attainment of treatment goals by providing invaluable information regarding the child's level of functioning and assisting the therapist with the development and implementation of treatment components such as exposure tasks. Parental involvement in treatment also gives the therapist an opportunity to more fully assess and address family factors that may be maintaining the child's anxiety. Common challenges encountered with parents that may impede treatment progress include rescuing the child from anxious situations, under- or over-involvement in the treatment process, difficulty setting limits, and the presence of parental psychopathology. Finally, the relevance of developmental level, child gender, diagnosis, and the presence of parental psychopathology to the decision of how and when to include parents in treatment is discussed.

AB  - Nighttime fear, including fear of monsters and the dark, is common. For most children and adolescents, nighttime fears are transient. However, approximately 10% experience severe nighttime fear that negatively impacts sleep, adjustment, and family life. Research conducted in the 1980s indicates that cognitive-behavioural therapy can reduce nighttime fear in as few as three sessions. The aims of the present study were to replicate and extend earlier research by evaluating a cognitive behavioural treatment package for children’s severe nighttime fear, and address methodological issues in previous studies. A manualised, multi-component treatment package was developed, based on current evidence-based practice for the treatment of children’s anxiety. Interventions included graded exposure, muscle relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and social and material reinforcement. Treatment was individually tailored and delivered via weekly modules. A multiple baseline across-subjects design was utilised. Four ‘families’ — one parent and one child — participated; children’s ages ranged from 6 to 10 years. Families attended five weekly intervention sessions and a 1-month follow-up. Multiple outcome measures were administered pre- and post-treatment. All children displayed changes consistent with reduced nighttime fear following treatment, including fewer phobic symptoms, reduced general fear, and improved nighttime and general behaviour. These changes were maintained at follow-up. Parents reported a high degree of satisfaction with the program and would recommend it to other families. The results support the effectiveness of manualised, parent-assisted treatment for nighttime fear in as few as three sessions. In cases of severe nighttime fear, therapist support is recommended. Treatment implications for children with complex presentations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite prevalence rates as high as 9.4%, few studies have examined the applicability of cognitive-behavioral therapy for treatment of anxiety disorders in very young children (i.e., below the age of 7 years). The present study examined the preliminary efficacy of a parent-led exposure therapy protocol (PLET) designed for young children with anxiety disorders. Twenty-two youth aged 4–7 years and their parents participated in this pilot randomized control trial. Families of youth with significant anxiety concerns were randomized to either PLET (n = 12), a 10 session/5-week family-based exposure therapy program designed to target anxiety in young children, or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 10). Children in the PLET condition demonstrated a greater reduction in anxiety symptoms compared to TAU (d = 3.18), with 90.91% of PLET participants (active condition) being classified as treatment responders at post-treatment as opposed to 0 in the TAU condition. Gains were maintained at 1 month-follow-up. Although pilot in nature, these data suggest in a preliminary fashion that a parent led exposure therapy protocol that is adapted appropriately for developmental age and incorporates an active coaching component for parents may be efficacious for the treatment of young children with anxiety disorders.

AB  - Background: Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) ratings are commonly used during exposure tasks in cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety. Aims: The present study examined patterns and predictors of SUDS in a sample of anxiety-disordered youth. Method: Youth (N = 99) aged 7 to 14 (M = 10.4, SD = 1.8) were treated with CBT for social phobia (SP), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and/or separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Analyses were conducted using hierarchical linear modeling. Results: Child's peak SUDS and magnitude of change in SUDS significantly increased between sessions. Higher child self-reported pretreatment total Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) score predicted greater change in SUDS within the first exposure session. Primary GAD diagnosis predicted less increase in change in SUDS between sessions. Conclusions: Results suggest that higher pretreatment total MASC scores are associated with increased first exposure within-session habituation. Additionally, youth with a principal diagnosis of GAD experienced less between-session habituation, perhaps because they may have required more imaginal than in-vivo exposures.

AB  - Across the world, as many as 80% of children experience traumatic events including physical abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence, community violence, and war/conflict/terrorism (United Nations, 2006). Although prevalence rates vary across studies, more than 30% of children experience one or more traumatic events by late adolescence (Copeland, Keeler, Angold, & Costello, 2007). Complexity of trauma experiences has been associated with diverse short- and long-term negative mental health outcomes, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other anxiety disorders, depression, risky behaviors (e.g., substance use), and disruptive behavior problems (Silverman et al., 2008). In one longitudinal study, those exposed to trauma had almost double the rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders and PTSD as non trauma-exposed children (Copeland et al., 2007). Exposure to violence also can result in greater vulnerability to social, emotional, and biological impairments over the course of the life time (e.g., Pervanidou, 2008). Taken together, these findings underscore the need for intervention for children and adolescents who have been exposed to trauma. This chapter examines treatment outcome studies of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments of PTSD in youth. The following sections include theoretical and practical arguments for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A number of specific treatment considerations, including developmental and cultural factors, are discussed. Factors related to treatment outcome are also mentioned. Research concerning pharmacological interventions is presented. Clinical implications and research recommendations are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Presents a case report of 17 year old girl the third of six children, referred following an inpatient hospitalization for medication management of anorexia nervosa (AN) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). V. was a 17-year-old adolescent girl referred for psychotherapy and medication treatment of anorexia nervosa following failed outpatient family based therapy, ultimately necessitating hospitalization for weight restitution and introduction of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). V.’s childhood development was characterized by early-onset social anxiety and OCD. From a biological perspective, V. may have been vulnerable to anorexia nervosa (AN) and OCD, as her family history was notable for significant perfectionistic traits. V.’s history of purging and severe malnourishment placed her at risk for medical complications, such as cardiac dysfunction, which she developed at her lowest weight. Dental enamel erosion and amenorrhea, often observed in adolescents with AN, had also occurred. Psychotherapeutic approaches should be informed by CBT, with exposure and response prevention to address OCD. In fact, some of the efficacy of FBT for AN is related to the use of exposures surrounding issues of food and nutrition. In this case, however, V. had a suboptimal response to FBT related to frequent non-adherence and anger. V.’s case demonstrates that a multimodal treatment approach, including behavioral techniques and pharmacotherapy, in patients with comorbid AN and OCD may be of high value in generating positive outcome for individuals with these comorbid diagnoses.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are common in children and adolescents with reported prevalence rates between 6% and 20%. A multimodal treatment approach is recommended for optimal outcome that comprises of psychotherapy (especially exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy), family and patient education, and use of medication if indicated. In patients who might benefit from use of medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drugs of choice. The safety and efficacy of medications other than SSRIs in the treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders are not fully established. Most children and adolescents respond well to treatment with long lasting resolution of symptoms, although, recurrence of the same, or development of a different type of anxiety disorder, is not uncommon. In most patients, anxiety disorders tend to persist into adulthood requiring long-term treatment planning.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is currently defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) maintained the inclusion of a stressor criterion that requires that one must have been exposed to threatened or actual harm to oneself or others (Cluster A). Notably, the stressor criterion was altered in terms of a subjective stressor element such that the previous requirement that the person needed to respond to the trauma with fear, horror, or helplessness was removed. This was done because the subjective element of the stressor criterion does not markedly alter PTSD prevalence, and it also potentially excludes some people who do not respond to the trauma with these reactions at the time (e.g., soldiers, survivors of mild traumatic brain injury). The preferred treatment for PTSD, as recommended by most treatment guidelines around the world, is trauma-focused psychotherapy. This form of therapy has been shown to be effective with many populations, including traumatic injury and assault, sexual assault, combat, terrorist attacks, refugees, and child sexual abuse. Despite the convergent finding of the efficacy of this approach, only two-thirds of PTSD patients adequately respond to this treatment. The most traditional variant of trauma-focused psychotherapy is trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy, which comprises psychoeducation about the trauma responses, anxiety management (including breathing retraining or relaxation training), prolonged exposure, and cognitive restructuring.

AB  - According to an epidemiological survey (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995), between 50 and 60% of the U.S. population will be exposed to a traumatic event in their lifetime. This may be in the form of childhood emotional, physical, or sexual abuse or neglect, motor vehicle accidents, natural disasters, military combat, the sudden loss of a loved one, physical assault or rape, or acts of terrorism. Thus, in the field of mental health, trauma is an unavoidable specter. These prevalence numbers highlight the importance of assessing for trauma exposure with patients (Engel & Ursano, 2008). Of course, not all traumatic experiences lead to a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma may be the catalyst for bouts of major depression, generalized anxiety, and even the development of psychotic processes; disorders that are addressed in other chapters of this volume. Therefore, a strong understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD becomes very valuable in differential diagnoses and treatment choices in clients exposed to traumatic experiences. Exposure therapy, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), remains the front-line treatment for PTSD (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2008), and evidence for the efficacy of other cognitive behavioral interventions continues to grow (Cukor, Spitalnick, Difede, Rizzo, & Rothbaum, 2009; Hembree & Foa, 2010). The goals of this chapter are to provide the reader with a strong understanding of the current cognitive behavioral conceptualization of this disorder and how this has informed the empirically supported treatments for PTSD, which will be outlined in some detail. In addition, we will briefly discuss some emerging/adjunct treatments for PTSD and attempt to address some of the complexities of treating this disorder.

AB  - Presents practice parameters for the assessment and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) based on a detailed literature review and expert consultation. In children and adolescents, OCD is often accompanied by a wide range of comorbidity, including mood, anxiety, attentional, and learning difficulties, and/or tic disorder. These parameters describe the relevant areas of assessment, especially symptomatology, onset, and course, other associated psychopathology, and developmental, family, and medical history (including postinfectious onset or exacerbations). Two modalities have been systematically assessed and empirically shown to ameliorate core symptoms: cognitive–behavioral therapy (primarily exposure/response prevention) and serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication. Data regarding the indications, efficacy, and implementation of these modalities are reviewed. Because OCD frequently occurs in the context of other psychopathology and adaptive difficulties, additional individual and family psychotherapeutic, pharmacological, and educational interventions often are necessary. Treatment planning guidelines are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Increasingly clinicians are being asked to assess and treat young refugees, who have experienced traumatic events due to war and organised violence. However, evidence-based guidance remains scarce. Method: Published studies on the mental health difficulties of refugee children and adolescents, associated risk and protective factors, as well as effective interventions, particularly those designed to reduce war-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, were identified and reviewed. The findings are summarised. Results: Young refugees are frequently subjected to multiple traumatic events and severe losses, as well as ongoing stressors within the host country. Although young refugees are often resilient, many experience mental health difficulties, including PTSD, depression, anxiety and grief. An awareness of relevant risk and protective factors is important. A phased model of intervention is often useful and the need for a holistic approach crucial. Promising treatments for alleviating symptoms of war-related PTSD include cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT), testimonial psychotherapy, narrative exposure therapy (NET) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Knowledge of the particular needs of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC), working with interpreters, cross-cultural differences, medico-legal report writing and the importance of clinician self-care is also necessary. Conclusion: More research is required in order to expand our limited knowledge base. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and result in low quality of life and a high social and economic cost. The efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders is well established, but a substantial proportion of patients do not respond to this treatment. Understanding which genetic and environmental factors are responsible for this differential response to treatment is a key step towards 'personalized medicine'. Based on previous research, our objective was to test whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and/or childhood maltreatment are associated with response trajectories during exposure-based CBT for panic disorder (PD). Method: We used Growth Mixture Modeling to identify latent classes of change (response trajectories) in patients with PD (N = 97) who underwent group manualized exposure-based CBT.We conducted logistic regression to investigate the effect on these trajectories of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and two different types of childhood maltreatment, abuse and neglect. Results: We identified two response trajectories ('high response' and 'low response'), and found that they were not significantly associated with either the genetic (BDNF Val66Met polymorphism) or childhood trauma-related variables of interest, nor with an interaction between these variables. Conclusions: We found no evidence to support an effect of the BDNF gene or childhood trauma-related variables on CBT outcome in PD. Future studies in this field may benefit from looking at other genotypes or using different (e.g. whole-genome) approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To identify predictors of treatment response in a large sample of pediatric participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The Nordic Long-term Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) Treatment Study (NordLOTS) included 269 children and adolescents, 7 to 17 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD. Outcomes were evaluated after 14 weekly sessions of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Method: The association of 20 potential predictors, identified by literature review, along with their outcomes, was evaluated using the Children’s Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) posttreatment. A CY-BOCS total score of ≤15 was the primary outcome measure. Results: The univariate analyses showed that children and adolescents who were older had more severe OCD, greater functional impairment, higher rates of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms before treatment had significantly poorer outcomes after 14 weeks of treatment. However, only age was a significant predictor in the multivariate model. Conclusion: In the multivariate analysis, only age predicted better treatment outcome. Using univariate analysis, a variety of predictors of poorer treatment outcome after CBT was identified. The high impact of comorbid symptoms on outcome in pediatric OCD suggests that treatment should address comorbidity issues. The lack of a family predictor may be related to high family involvement in this study. Future research strategies should focus on optimizing intervention in the presence of these characteristics to achieve greater benefits for patients with OCD.

AB  - Severe health anxiety can be effectively treated with exposure-based Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT), but information about which factors that predict outcome is scarce. Using data from a recently conducted RCT comparing ICBT (n = 79) with Internet-delivered behavioral stress management (IBSM) (n = 79) the presented study investigated predictors of treatment outcome. Analyses were conducted using a two-step linear regression approach and the dependent variable was operationalized both as end state health anxiety at post-treatment and as baseline-to post-treatment improvement. A hypothesis driven approach was used where predictors expected to influence outcome were based on a previous predictor study by our research group. As hypothesized, the results showed that baseline health anxiety and treatment adherence predicted both end state health anxiety and improvement. In addition, anxiety sensitivity, treatment credibility, and working alliance were significant predictors of health anxiety improvement. Demographic variables, i.e. age, gender, marital status, computer skills, educational level, and having children, had no significant predictive value. We conclude that it is possible to predict a substantial proportion of the outcome variance in ICBT and IBSM for severe health anxiety. The findings of the present study can be of high clinical value as they provide information about factors of importance for outcome in the treatment of severe health anxiety.

AB  - Background and objectives: Pretreatment attention bias towards threat stimuli has been shown to predict treatment outcomes following exposure-based treatments. The extent of emotional variability experienced during exposure therapy has also been found to predict better treatment outcomes in anxious adults. The present study examined whether pretreatment attention bias towards threat stimuli and greater emotional variability during exposure activities were associated with stronger treatment outcomes in anxious children receiving group-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Methods: Twenty-six anxious children completed a visual probe task with emotional faces, followed by a 10-week CBT program in a group format. Children completed weekly within-session exposure activities during the last 5 weeks of group CBT. Results: Pretreatment attention bias towards threat stimuli, greater emotional variability and within-session habituation during exposure activities were significantly associated with reductions in clinician- and/or parent-rated anxiety symptoms after the 10-week CBT program. Treatment responders had significantly higher peak emotional distress ratings during exposure activities. However, threat attention bias and within-session exposure measures were not significantly related. Conclusions: Pre-existing individual differences in attention bias to threat cues and the degree of emotional reactivity experienced during exposure activities are both important independent predictors of treatment outcomes for anxious children receiving group-based CBT.

AB  - Prevention and treatment of post-traumatic psychopathology among children have become important items of the mental health agenda. Though little research has been conducted so far, there is growing interest among researchers. For prevention, a better understanding of risk and protective factors for PTSD following a trauma is needed in order to develop targeted interventions for high risk children. For treatment, identification of the critical ingredients of CBT may lead to more precise, effective, and affordable interventions. Pharmacological treatments are worth pursuing for selected patients. The combined application of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches should be studied. More in general, what is especially promising for the treatment of PTSD is the presence of theoretically driven models that are grounded on the recent understanding of the brain circuitries of fear and anxiety. How to deal with the psychological consequences of indirect exposure to traumatic events, most typically terrorism, has become a timely and crucial area of inquiry with enormous implications. In fact, to successfully address this challenge will mean not only to improve the health and well being of traumatized individuals, but to avert the main aim and purpose of terrorism.

AB  - This article elucidates the theoretical underpinnings of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) as applied to the treatment of anxiety disorders in children, focusing on social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder. It reviews behavioral and cognitive theories that have influenced this approach. We argue that it is necessary to understand the essential components of this approach in the context of these theories in order to provide effective, clinically sensitive, and child-focused treatment. Components discussed include assessment, psychoeducation, affective education, self-instruction training, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, relaxation training, modeling, contingency management, and exposure procedures. Hypothesized key processes, such as the need to be experiential in treatment, are presented for consideration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tokophobia is a relatively unknown, although quite frequent, anxiety disorder. It is characterized by an excessive and persistent fear of childbirth, and accompanied by avoidance behaviors that may affect pregnancy, despite the patient's wish for a child, or childbirth. Tokophobia may explain some requests for abortions or elective Caesarean sections. The avoidance behaviors of the feared situation clearly distinguish tokophobia from a simple, and normal, fear of childbirth. Tokophobia is considered 'primary' when it precedes the first conception, or 'secondary' if it is consecutive to childbirth, for which the subjective experience was negative. It can also be associated with prenatal depression, of which it is a symptomatic component. This disorder can be associated with obstetric or postpartum complications. Despite its frequency and its disabling features, treatment has been the subject of little research, and most of the studies are more closely related to simple fear of childbirth rather than tokophobia. No study was identified using cognitive behavior therapy for tokophobia. The current article reports on the case of a 31-year-old patient suffering from primary tokophobia, that started in adolescence, and was characterized by symptoms of panic anxiety in various situations evoking pregnancy or childbirth. Fears led the patient to avoid pregnancy despite her desire for a child. There was no medical or other psychiatric history apart from a simple insect phobia; no sexual abuse was reported. Cognitive behavior therapy was carried out according to a protocol classically used in specific phobias; treatment was conducted in 20 sessions, over 10 months. Psychoeducation was conducted on the progression of childbirth as well as on phobic anxiety; cognitive restructuring was centered on biased representations and feelings of inability. Graded exposure to anxiety-provoking thoughts and images concerning the different stages of labour was also performed. These therapeutic tools were combined during the course of therapy given the evolution of the presenting clinical features. The results were clinically significant in reducing fears related to childbirth as shown by a 43% reduction of the total score on the adapted Traumatic Event Scale. Feelings of inability to carry out a pregnancy decreased from 9.5/10 before treatment to less than 2/10 at the end of therapy, allowing the patient to serenely consider this possibility. On the Clinical Global Impression scale, the severity of the illness decreased from 5 ('markedly ill') to 2 ('borderline mentally ill') and the improvement relative to baseline was rated as 'very much improved'. This case report suggests that a cognitive behavior therapy protocol using conventional techniques employed in the treatment of specific phobias is both applicable and likely to induce significant clinical improvement in primary tokophobia. Further studies are needed to validate this approach.unknown, although quite frequent, anxiety disorder.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an empirically supported treatment for anxiety in youth. Recent efforts have been underway to elucidate the evidence- based process factors that are associated with successful outcomes. These factors have included both therapy content (homework; exposure tasks) and therapy process (therapeutic alliance; therapist actions). Although exposure tasks have been identified as a key component of CBT, they are not always implemented with the greatest efficacy, in session or at home. Successful implementation of exposure tasks may rely, in part, on a strong therapeutic alliance. Furthermore, therapist actions influence the alliance and client motivation and participation in homework and exposure tasks. A review of the relevant literature indicates that additional research is needed to elucidate the interaction between therapeutic process factors, such as alliance and therapist actions, and therapeutic content, including exposure tasks.

AB  - Psychoeducation is the most important task in order to establish a common understanding of the nature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and its treatment between therapist, child, and parents. Treatment of OCD in terms of exposure and response prevention (E/RP) is more challenging than other psychotherapies, because it depends on compliance with anxiety-provoking exposure exercises. Understanding the treatment rationale and compliance with exposure instructions is significantly related to lower posttreatment OCD symptom severity in an adult sample, which suggests that a strong emphasis on psychoeducation may lay the groundwork for subsequent success. The main aim of psychoeducation is to build a model of understanding the symptoms and the treatment allowing all parties involved to work together as a team. To reach this goal, information should be balanced and based on current research and clinical experience. This chapter describes a step-by-step process and instructions for therapists on how to provide psychoeducation to children and adolescents with OCD and their caretakers or relatives. In this chapter we use the term children referring to children and adolescents. When children and adolescents are distinguished, this is indicated. We also use the term parents referring to all caretakers and relatives involved in the therapeutic process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Research on D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) agonist, has suggested that it may enhance exposure-based therapies for anxiety disorders. Results with DCS in adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been conflicting; however, no data have been reported on children with PTSD. Although many individuals with PTSD respond to exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), there are subgroups of individuals who are nonresponders, and many responders still have substantial residual symptoms. This randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled study tested DCS as an adjunct to CBT to improve and speed treatment response for PTSD in youth. Methods: Seven to 18 year-old youth with exposure to trauma and PTSD were offered a 12 session, manualized CBT treatment. Those who remained in treatment at the fifth session were randomly allocated (n = 57) to either CBT and DCS or CBT and placebo. Results: Youth in the CBT and DCS group had significant reductions in symptoms, but these reductions were not greater than those in the CBT and placebo group. There was a trend toward DCS speeding PTSD symptom recovery during the exposure-based sessions, and evidence that the CBT and DCS group better maintained stability of gains on inattention ratings from posttreatment to the 3 month follow-up. Conclusions: This initial study of CBT and DCS to treat pediatric PTSD provided suggestive and preliminary evidence for more rapid symptom recovery and beneficial effects on attention, but did not show an overall greater effect for reducing PTSD symptoms. It appears that augmentation with DCS represents unique challenges in PTSD. Because PTSD involves complex, lifethreatening trauma memories, as opposed to the imagined dreadful outcomes of other anxiety disorders, the use of DCS may require greater attention to how its use is coupled with exposure-based techniques. DCS may have inadvertently enhanced reconsolidation of trauma memories rather than more positive and adaptive memories. In addition, the results suggest that future research could focus on the longer-term benefits of DCS on attention and ways to capitalize on attention-enhancing therapies.

AB  - This review covers three themes of research that brought fresh data useful for clinical practice in a handicapping anxiety disorder: social phobia. Recent findings deriving from basic biological research, new forms of psychological therapies, and recent psychopharmacology controlled trials are reviewed. Recent findings: The basic neuroimaging research suggests that greater activation of the amygdala to novel versus familiar faces may be an underlying trait marker for social phobia. Social phobia may represent a phenotype that expresses a genetically driven trait of social withdrawal, which may be related to infantile inhibited temperament (Kagan's syndrome). The development of virtual reality therapy as therapeutic tool for social phobia appeared promising in one controlled, but not randomized, study. A controlled study suggests that social phobias in children can be effectively treated with cognitive behavioural therapy. This represents an extension of the work done with adults. Venlafaxine appears an effective short-term treatment for social anxiety disorder in two controlled studies. A new compound, pregabalin, appeared clearly effective in a positive controlled study. This trial marks the advent of a new pharmacological lineage for social phobia. Both venlafaxine and pregabalin, however, have been studied in short-term studies. Longer follow-up and relapse prevention studies are warranted. Summary: Neuroimaging research points to a temperamental basis for social phobia. Virtual reality therapy is an emerging tool to carry out exposure treatment. Group cognitive behavioural therapy can be extended successfully to children. Venlafaxine and pregabalin have a proven short-term effectiveness in social phobia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research has shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. CBT incorporates techniques such as cognitive restructuring and exposure, which foster symptom reduction. While these components promote sustained fear reduction, greater attention to relapse prevention (RP) may be warranted, particularly given the comorbidity associated with anxiety disorders. A case example demonstrates a comprehensive relapse prevention (RP) component. Specifically, parental involvement was emphasized as well as the creation of a bound book that consolidated skills and provided a concrete resource for potential future anxious episodes.

AB  - Reviews the book, CBT with Children, Adolescents and Families Anxiety: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy with Children and Young People by Paul Stallard. This book is part of what is set to become a comprehensive and useful series on Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for children and young people. The structure of the book is clear and takes the reader through the common anxiety disorders, models of treatment and the evidence for the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders (Chapters 1 and 2). Following on from that, in Chapters 3 and 4, the reader is guided through the basic principles of CBT, from common dysfunctional cognitive processes. The assessment, formulation and treatment chapters (Chapters 5-9) are equally helpful for the various stages of intervention, offering a step by step guide to cognitive behavior therapy with children and young people. Chapter 9 is dedicated to problem solving, exposure and relapse prevention and Chapter 11 deals with common problems to emerge with this population (e.g. an unsupportive family context, promoting 'ownership', limited intellectual ability) and offers simple solutions that can be tried. The book concludes with Chapter 12, which contains a selection of worksheets and other materials that work well with many children and young people. Helpfully, these can also be downloaded from the web. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book, Cognitive behavioral therapy with children: A guide for the community practitioner by K. Manassis (see record [rid]2009-01291-000[/rid]). This book is a clearly written and concise guide for therapists who may have had some exposure to a manualized CBT program for children, but have had little formal training or supervision in CBT. While there is a heavy focus on anxiety and depression, the book is really about how CBT is applied in the real world. Therapists with limited experience of CBT should find the many checklists and modules for assisting anxious and/or depressed children very helpful. The author also provides numerous case examples and anecdotes, as well as references to the evidence base and helpful websites for materials. There are simple, how-to explanations about complicated topics, such as adapting treatment for young people with LD, ASD or serious health problems, and handling reluctant kids/families, which should help guide the novice CBT therapist towards a more nuanced practice.

AB  - Reviews the book, Cognitive Therapy Techniques for Children and Adolescents: Tools for Enhancing Practice by Robert D. Friedberg, Jessica M. McClure, and Jolene Hillwig Garcia (see record [rid]2009-12294-000[/rid]). The book includes eight chapters focused on background information, assessment, and therapeutic interventions. Each chapter provides readers with the right combination of background knowledge and useful therapeutic tools. The introductory chapter provides an overview of both the book itself and the modular treatment approach. The assessment chapter explains how a thorough assessment informs treatment selection. This chapter is divided into different problem areas and lists common self-report and diagnostic assessments used for each disorder (e.g. anxiety, depression, pervasive developmental disorders). In addition, the chapter covers idiographic assessment and provides a number of developmentally appropriate self-monitoring techniques that can be used with children and adolescents. The remaining chapters focus on the core cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) strategies: behavioral interventions (e.g. social skills training, activity scheduling), self-instruction and cognitive restructuring methods, rational analysis, and exposure/experiential methods. Each chapter provides a rationale for when and why a strategy is used as well as a comprehensive list of creative CBT techniques. An extremely useful feature of the book is that each chapter provides a list of therapeutic techniques appropriate for youths ages 5 and older. The techniques are engaging, developmentally appropriate, and easy to implement. Each technique is carefully described, and the authors provide 38 corresponding handouts/work sheets that can be used in clinical practice. This book will serve as an excellent resource for graduate students and clinicians working with children and adolescents, especially for those looking for a single volume that explains a wide range of CBT techniques in a clear, concise manner.

AB  - Reviews the book, Treating Trauma and Traumatic Grief in Children and Adolescents by Judith A. Cohen, Anthony P. Mannarino, and Esther (see record [rid]2006-11899-000[/rid]). The book describes what some consider the best available treatment for children who are suffering from the sequelae to trauma. The information offered in this book extends that which was presented in an earlier book and treatment manuals on trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy for traumatized children, childhood traumatic grief and children who have experienced sexual abuse written by the authors. The book is well written and the treatment protocol is easy to follow for clinicians with a background in exposure-based therapies. The book is also very accessible given its detailed organization. It is highly recommended for clinicians working with child and adolescent clients who suffer from depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.

AB  - Objective: Paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition with lifetime prevalence estimates of 1% to 3%. It is often associated with severe disruptions of family functioning and impairment of peer relationships as well as academic performance. The OCD Expert Consensus Guidelines for treating childhood obsessive compulsive disorder recommend cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment of choice for prepubescent children. However, availability of cognitive behaviour therapy for paediatric obsessive compulsive disorder in the community is scarce. Moreover, there is a lack of treatment approaches specifically designed for younger children who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. Method: In order to enhance dissemination of empirically supported treatments, the therapeutic video game Ricky and the Spider (www.rickyandthespider.uzh.ch) was developed for children between the ages of 6 and 12 who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. The game is not a self-help game and should be played under the guidance of a therapist. It offers a child-friendly metaphor to understand obsessive compulsive disorder and the cognitive-behavioural treatment approach by incorporating the following elements: psycho-education, the cognitive model of obsessive compulsive disorder, creating a symptom hierarchy, the use of externalizing techniques to cope with anxiety and unpleasant feelings, and exposure—response prevention exercises. The game exists in German and English. Results: Ricky and the Spider is available since January 2012 and, up to now, has been purchased by 56 child psychiatric institutions or practitioners in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. In a preliminary evaluation, 13 therapists conveyed data of 18 children with a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder in whose therapy the game was used. According to their therapists, all children had enjoyed playing the game during therapy. Therapists perceived the game as helpful for the explanation of important CBT concepts and to enhance child motivation for therapy. OCD was judged as remarkably less severe in the case of fifteen children and as unchanged in one child. All 15 children who answered the questionnaire reported being satisfied their therapist had used Ricky and the Spider during treatment, and they all appreciated the game as helpful to understand their OCD. A clear limitation of the data is the small number and the lack of a control group. Conclusions: Preliminary data on the applicability and appropriateness of Ricky and the Spider show that the game seems to be well accepted by young children affected with obsessive compulsive disorder. Moreover, therapists perceive the game as helpful for the explanation of the CBT treatment approach for OCD and to enhance child motivation for treatment. However, Ricky and the Spider is only a therapeutic tool and cannot replace the therapist. As children and adolescents with obsessive compulsive disorder have a heightened risk for clinically significant psychiatric and psychosocial problems as adults, intervening early offers an important opportunity to prevent the development of long-standing problem behaviours.

AB  - This companion workbook for patients, and the therapist guide (see record [rid]2008-05009-000[/rid]), address the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia in adolescents. The onset of the disorder often occurs in adolescence and, left untreated, panic symptoms can continue into adulthood. Adolescence is a time of significant developmental growth, and therefore the impact of the disorder can be severe. Panic disorder and agoraphobia can interfere with school attendance, social functioning, and autonomous development. It has also been associated with higher rates of depression. This guide uses a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach based on the well-established MAP treatment program for adults. It has been specifically developed and tested for use with adolescents ages 12-17. Through psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and exposure techniques, adolescents learn about the nature of anxiety and panic and how to face their fears. An optional parent component involves parents in each session; handouts provide them with tips for parenting their anxious teen. The guide also offers suggestions on adapting the material for younger patients and for intensive treatment. For therapists working with the adolescent population, this guide is a unique and valuable resource. It offers a proven and effective treatment that helps therapists work with adolescents to overcome their avoidance and deal with their panic.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 1% to 3% of children and can be quite debilitating. However, OCD in youngsters can be successfully treated with the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques of exposure and response prevention (ERP). ERP involves gradually facing one's fears to test their reality while refraining from rituals. It helps people with OCD realize that their obsessive fears do not come true even when they resist rituals, and that the anxiety they experience subsides as a result of autonomic habituation. CBT is widely considered the treatment of choice for children with OCD, with a 65% to 80% success rate. However, effectiveness is contingent on overcoming a formidable obstacle: the child's intuitive reluctance to engage in ERP because he thinks that facing his fears without performing rituals will simply be too frightening. The child's disinclination can be challenging for the therapist, who must find ways to engage the child and obtain participation. My focus in treating OCD in children and adolescents has been on making empirically proven CBT user-friendly for children, parents, and therapists in everyday clinical practice. ERP works; getting children (and sometimes parents) to understand it, believe it, and do it—therein lies the challenge that calls for creativity, flexibility, and clinical artistry in implementation. Through my early years of less-than-desirable success in treating youngsters with OCD, I asked myself, 'How can I get a child to buy into the treatment? How can I bridge the gap between hearing, believing, and doing? What can I do to engage children and families to stay in treatment without dropping out prematurely?' These questions shaped the evolution of the following clinical concepts and applications: Pearl #1: Cultivate treatment readiness; Pearl #2: Clarify the right versus the wrong goal of treatment; and Pearl #3: Take the RIDE up and down the Worry Hill.

AB  - Examined child behavior during exposure and characteristics of exposure tasks as related to outcomes when treating anxious youth. Participants were 87 anxietydisordered children, 50 males and 37 females (ages 7.03-13.81 years), and their parents (84 mothers; 70 fathers) who completed a 16-session cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety. Videotapes of exposure-based therapy sessions were coded for (a) child use of safety-seeking behavior (SSB) and coping behavior (CB) during exposure, (b) exposure task characteristics, and (c) child's peak anxiety level during exposure. Results indicated that (a) SSB, but not CB, during exposure tasks was significantly predictive of treatment outcome, specifically poorer outcome; (b) SSB was significantly higher during exposure tasks for treatment nonresponders than for responders, whereas CB was significantly higher for treatment responders than nonresponders; (c) SSB increased over the course of exposure tasks, whereas CB remained stable; and (d) peak anxiety levels and exposure task characteristics were not significantly associated with treatment outcome, with the exception of lower average number of exposure tasks conducted per session, which was associated with better outcome. Findings are discussed with reference to clinical implications and suggestions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common psychopathology in children and adolescents, affecting over 30% before adulthood. With median age of onset ranging from 6 to 14 years, anxiety disorders are among the earliest classes of psychopathology to develop. Youth with anxiety disorders experience significant subjective distress and disability that negatively affects friendships, family relationships, and academic achievement. The school environment is an ecologically valid setting for treating anxiety disorders. Common triggers of anxiety for youth are often found at school, ranging from worries about tests and class presentations to separating from caregivers and talking with new peers. Therefore, implementing treatment for anxiety disorders in schools provides opportunities to practice new skills and engage in exposure exercises in a realworld setting that may promote generalization. This chapter will present five school-based treatments for anxiety that have been evaluated in controlled trials. School-based trials implemented by research-based providers have demonstrated support for transportability to schools for most of these programs. More recently, a limited number of school-based trials implemented by schoolbased providers have examined whether these programs can be delivered by school personnel with limited background in CBT. In reviewing both types of school-based studies, we will describe the treatment programs, present clinical outcome data, and include available information on treatment fidelity or the degree to which an intervention is implemented as intended. The order in which the programs are described reflects the types of anxiety they address; programs treating a range of anxiety problems are presented first, followed by programs treating specific anxiety disorders (e.g., social phobia). We will conclude by highlighting critical next steps the field must address to successfully disseminate school-based interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a school-based group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety disorders with African-American adolescents. Twelve adolescents (mean age = 15.6 years) with anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 6) or a group attention-support control condition (AS-Control; n = 6). Both groups met for 10 sessions in the same high school. Key treatment ingredients in CBT involved exposure, relaxation, social skills, and cognitive restructuring. Key ingredients in AS-Control involved therapist and peer support. At preand posttreatment, diagnostic interviews were conducted, and adolescents completed self-report measures of anxiety. At posttreatment and among those who attended more than one treatment session, 3/4 adolescents in CBT no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary anxiety disorder, compared with 1/5 in AS-Control. Clinician ratings of impairment and self-report levels of overall anxiety were significantly lower at posttreatment in CBT compared with ASControl. Teenagers in both groups reported lower levels of social anxiety from pre- to posttreatment. Findings support the feasibility of implementing a manual-based CBT in an urban school setting.

AB  - Objective: Multilevel growth analysis was used to establish the mean growth trajectory (shape of change) for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth with anxiety disorders. Two-level growth analysis was conducted to identify important between-youth predictors of session-by-session symptom change. Method: Fifty-five youth (ages 7–17; 50.9% male) and their parents participated in a 16- to 20-week CBT that emphasized affective, cognitive, and exposure-based exercises. Multilevel growth models (MLMs) were estimated to model session symptom data taking into account an 'anxiety spike' hypothesized to occur at initiation of exposure sessions. Three models were compared: a cubic curve, a log-linear curve plus an exposure covariate, and a linear curve plus exposure covariate. Two-level MLM examined the effect of demographic traits (sex, age, race/ethnicity), pretreatment symptom severity, comorbid school refusal, early treatment factors (use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication, therapeutic alliance, treatment attrition), and pretreatment coping (engagement, disengagement, and involuntary coping). Results: Fit indices provided support for the cubic growth model using either parent or youth anxiety data. Level 2 analysis identified youth age, symptom severity (anxiety, externalizing), early attrition, and engagement and disengagement coping as significant predictors of symptom trajectories. Predictors accounted for 34%–37% of between-youth variance in midtreatment anxiety scores. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the symptom course of CBT, and the effect of between-youth factors on treatment outcomes, is more complex than previously thought. Educating therapists and clients about findings can aid treatment expectations and dissemination efforts of empirically supported treatments.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been reviewed and described as an empirically supported treatment for anxious youth. One component of CBT is the use of out-of-session 'Show That I Can' tasks (STIC; i.e., homework tasks). STIC tasks vary in content and are to be completed between sessions. We discuss homework in CBT for Robert, a 13-year-old boy with social anxiety. Robert experienced distressing anxiety participating in and giving presentations at school and was fearful of open-ended questions. Robert had difficulty maintaining conversations with peers and reported being preoccupied with a concern that he would say something 'weird' or 'stupid.' Robert avoided numerous situations, and his social anxiety affected his grades, social interactions, family, and quality of life. Robert's initial homework tasks entailed (a) journaling and self-monitoring anxious feelings and thoughts, and (b) practicing relaxation skills. During the second half of treatment, Robert's STIC assignments were exposure tasks, including (a) opinion discussion assignments, (b) participating in class, and (c) initiating conversations with children at the bus stop. The present discussion focuses on how homework was individualized and presented so that it was palatable and sensitive. Issues regarding out-of-session exposure tasks that elicit sufficient anxiety, resistance to high-level exposure tasks, and parent involvement are explored.

AB  - This review aimed to identify the strategies used in programs based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to prevent and treat symptoms of anxiety, depression, and internalized behaviors of children and adolescents. Based on an online search (ERIC, PsycInfo, Virtuose UQAM, and Google Scholar), 61 studies describing different cognitive behavioral programs were selected. Results showed that 40 strategies were implemented in at least one program. However, none of the strategies were systematically present in all programs, and only few were reported in more than 50% of the studies. Cognitive restructuring and problem-solving were the most popular strategies to treat depressive symptoms, whereas anxiety programs also generally included relaxation and exposure. Furthermore, six strategies were identified in a single anxiety program, whereas nine strategies were implemented in only one depression program. These results suggest that in anxiety and depression programs designed for children and adolescents, the label 'CBT' encompasses a wide variety of programs with only few similar strategies. Such findings highlight the need to define a common basis for CBT programs, in order to better reflect CBT theory and to identify the effectiveness of the strategies included in these programs.

AB  - Identifying factors that promote sustained implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) after therapists receive training is critical for professional psychology. To address the field’s minimal knowledge in this area, we interviewed community-based therapists (N = 23) who had completed intensive training in cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for either anxiety or depression as part of a randomized effectiveness trial (Southam-Gerow et al., 2010; Weisz et al., 2009). Therapists were interviewed 3 to 5 years after completion of the initial trial, representing one of the longest-term follow-ups of therapist practices after training. Therapists viewed each protocol and their individual CBT strategies as effective and appropriate for the majority of their current anxiety and depression caseloads. However, therapists used parts of each protocol much more frequently than the protocol as a whole (i.e., 78.5% used parts of the Coping Cat, and 7.5% used the whole protocol; 58.6% used parts of the PASCET, and 20% used the whole protocol). Therapists reported using problem-solving the most and exposure exercises the least for current anxious cases; they used cognitive restructuring the most and homework the least for current depression cases. Interventions that were more difficult to implement in usual care settings appeared less likely to be sustained. Future efforts should evaluate the characteristics and structure of EBTs that are most acceptable to therapists and should investigate which kinds of ongoing learning supports will maintain therapist skills in and continued use of EBTs.

AB  - Presents a review on technology at the service of pediatric mental health. The aim of this review is to describe the diverse applications of pediatric telepsychiatry by highlighting research from its main categories to offer evidence-based guidance for current practice and to offer suggestions for future investigation. The searched articles represented a varied body of interventions and platforms that fell into one of 5 general categories: computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which uses downloadable programs to offer standardized therapy in the CBT mode without using the Internet; online therapy, which leverages Internet interactivity and other functionalities to offer therapy of various types; remote pharmacotherapy, which uses the Internet to offer psychopharmacologic evaluation; mobile tools, which use 'smartphone' capabilities to provide treatment or supplement it via appointment reminders and symptom reporting features; and virtual reality exposure therapy, which desensitizes patients to phobias and anxiety triggers by using virtual reality to recreate them. Considering how integrated technology has become in all aspects of children's and adolescents' lives, digital platforms stand a good chance of being embraced, and they carry considerable potential. Privacy safeguards, along with better data, can make digital technology a potent ally as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Behavioral exposure has been identified as an integral component of successful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth with distressing anxiety. Despite the evidence supporting the efficacy of exposures, they are often underutilized in community settings. Although flexible implementation of exposures is recommended, specific guidelines on how to execute individualized exposures are largely lacking. The following paper outlines ways to adapt and tailor exposures to the individual presentation, translating the process into meaningful therapeutic gains. First, the article reviews creative methods to promote youth's motivation and engagement (e.g. through the use of games, technology, and other personalization strategies). Second, the paper outlines generalization of exposure into the child's daily life (e.g. at home, at school, and overtime). The paper concludes with a discussion of areas for future exposure-related research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present case study illustrates how a family cognitive-behavioral therapy (FCBT) was used to treat a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder and agoraphobia without panic. The first half of treatment focused on teaching specific coping skills, whereas the second half consisted of exposure tasks that provided opportunities for Molly to practice what she had learned. The therapy also addressed issues of family communication and emotional expression. Through flexible application of the manual, the therapist helped Molly's parents recognize how their expectations affected their daughter's behavior and helped Molly with her own self-image and expectations for coping. Following treatment, Molly and her parents reported that her anxiety had decreased and that her coping skills had improved. Overall, this case illustrates the successful application of FCBT and highlights the importance of applying a treatment manual flexibly to address client needs.

AB  - This preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the feasibility of dismantling cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety disorders. Fourteen children (10 girls) ages 7 to 14 (m = 10.2) with social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or panic disorder were randomized to receive 6 sessions of either a) the pre-exposure anxiety management strategies presented in traditional CBT, or b) parent-coached exposure therapy. The sample was selected from a treatment seeking population and is representative of children in clinical settings. Examination of fidelity ratings, dropouts, and satisfaction ratings indicated that the interventions were distinguishable, safe, and tolerable. The overall sample improved significantly with pre-post effect sizes generally in the large range for both conditions. Between-group effect sizes indicating greater improvement with parent-coached exposure therapy were moderate or large for ten of 12 variables (i.e., 0.53 to 1.52). Re-evaluation after three months of open treatment suggested that the intervention emphasizing exposure early maintained its superiority while requiring fewer appointments.

AB  - Discusses the case of a 45-yr-old postal employee evaluated at a clinic specializing in the treatment of depression. Indeed, he has been depressed and has experienced only limited interest and enjoyment ever since he was a child. Although his depressed mood has been associated with pessimism, low energy, and difficulty concentrating, other symptoms of a Major Depressive Episode, such as appetite and sleep disturbance, have not been present. This chronic mild depression is diagnosed as Dysthymic Disorder, which is further qualified as Early Onset. In addition, the patient has lifelong social anxiety that makes it difficult for him to maintain even the most minimal social contact. His fear is that he will have nothing to say and will be thought of as a 'jerk.' This fear seems to be independent of his Dysthymic Disorder and therefore justifies the additional diagnosis of Social Phobia, Generalized Type. After establishing the scope of his social anxiety and dysfunction, the author would ask him in which situations he is comfortable. Defining a current scope of comfortable activities will remind both patient and therapist that he is not a 'jerk' but has some social capabilities on which he can build during his therapy. His social priorities and goals for treatment would allow the therapist to direct him toward those behavioral exposure activities for which he is most motivated and evaluate the personal significance of the gains he achieves in treatment. The best-established treatments for Generalized Social Phobia are cognitive-behavioral therapies and the use of medications from one of several classes, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and benzodiazepines. Cognitive-behavioral therapy offers the advantage of better long-term maintenance of gains after discontinuation of treatment, which is an important consideration for people with such a chronic disorder.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are often undertreated due to unsuccessful dissemination of evidence-based treatments (EBTs). Lack of empirical data regarding the typical length of treatment in clinical settings may hamper the development of clinically relevant protocols. The current study examined billing records for 335 children ages 7–17 years to quantify the treatment received for newly diagnosed anxiety disorders within a regional health system. The vast majority of patients did not receive a sufficient number of appointments to complete the typical cognitive behavioral therapy protocol or reach the sessions introducing exposure. Although half of the sample received pharmacotherapy, the vast majority received fewer follow-up appointments than participants in pharmacotherapy research studies. Further, the type of treatment (i.e., number of sessions and medication) differed depending on utilization of specialty care. These results underscore the need to develop brief and flexible EBT protocols that can be standardized and implemented in community practice.

AB  - Although cognitive−behavioural therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective treatments for childhood anxiety disorders, the extent to which these interventions comprise usual care is unclear. This study evaluated the management of childhood anxiety in Ontario within 56 publicly funded community- and hospital-based mental health centers using a population survey. Psychologists and psychiatrists rated the frequency of interventions provided within their settings, with results highlighting only moderate access to evidence-based CBT and SSRI treatments. Exposure, a core component of CBT for anxiety, was underutilized. Usual care most often entailed psychoeducation, relaxation training, and family-based approaches. Consistent with established guidelines, combined interventions were typically used to treat moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Practitioners recommended similar care sequences, with the majority beginning with psychotherapy. Difficulties accessing CBT in publicly funded settings in Ontario may be due to the low number of practitioners with expertise in CBT. Implications for the translation and dissemination of evidence-based treatments into clinical settings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Il est reconnu que la thérapie cognitivo-comportementale (TCC) et les inhibiteurs sélectifs de la recapture de la sérotonine (ISRS) sont des méthodes efficaces pour traiter les troubles d’anxiété chez l’enfant. Or, la mesure dans laquelle ces interventions comprennent des soins habituels n’est pas claire. Cette étude a évalué la gestion de l’anxiété chez des enfants répartis à travers 56 centres de santé mentale communautaires et hospitaliers publics de l’Ontario au moyen d’une enquête en population. Les psychologues et psychiatres ont évalué la fréquence des interventions pratiquées dans leurs établissements dont les résultats ont révélé un accès minime à la TCC et à l’ISRS, deux méthodes de traitement fondées sur les preuves. L’exposition, un élément central de la TCC en ce qui a trait à l’anxiété, a été sous-utilisée. Les soins habituels incluaient le plus souvent la psychopédagogie, les techniques de relaxation et les approches axées sur la famille. Conformément aux directives établies, les interventions combinées étaient généralement utilisées pour traiter les cas d’anxiété de niveau modéré à élevé. Les praticiens ont recommandé des séquences de soins similaires, dont la majorité commençait avec la psychothérapie. La difficulté d’accès à la TCC dans les établissements de santé publics de l’Ontario pourrait être attribuable au faible nombre de praticiens ayant une expertise en TCC. Les implications relatives à la traduction et la diffusion de traitements fondés sur des preuves dans des contextes cliniques y sont abordées.

AB  - Anxiety is one of the most common co-occurring diagnoses in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment that has been tailored for youth with ASD and anxiety and has shown good efficacy in reducing youth anxiety immediately after treatment. One area that has not been widely studied is acceptability of CBT for anxiety in this population. Acceptability includes beliefs about the potential helpfulness and satisfaction with a given treatment and may be important in understanding treatment outcomes. This study focuses on parent, youth, and clinician acceptability of a well-researched CBT program, Facing Your Fears, for youth with ASD and anxiety. Data was collected as part of a larger multi-site study that compared three different instructional conditions for clinicians learning the intervention. Results indicated that parents rated acceptability as higher for the overall treatment compared to youth. Further, youth and parents rated exposure related sessions as more acceptable than psychoeducation, and higher exposure acceptability ratings were predictive of lower youth anxiety levels post-treatment. Clinicians who received ongoing consultation rated treatment acceptability lower than clinicians in the other training conditions. While some clinicians may be hesitant to implement exposure techniques with this population, findings suggest that it is the technique that parents and youth rated as the most acceptable. Results are discussed in terms of treatment and research implications for youth with ASD and their families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) represents the gold standard treatment for pediatric anxiety disorders, research has indicated opportunities to further advance its effectiveness and efficacy. Studies identifying the core active CBT ingredients and moderators of treatment outcome can facilitate such advancement. The current study utilized an observational coding measure to evaluate the relative strength of therapist Exposure and Cognitive Extensiveness associated with session-by-session and post-treatment outcomes. Participants (aged 8-17) were 73 youth with a principal anxiety disorder diagnosis who completed a manual-based CBT protocol (Coping Cat; Kendall & Hedtke, 2006). Video recordings of two exposure sessions per participant was observed and coded for Exposure and Cognitive Extensiveness. Anxiety symptoms were rated by clinicians at pre- and post-treatment, as well as by children and parents prior to each session and at post-treatment. Session-by-session multiple regression analysis indicated a trend for Exposure Extensiveness to be associated with increased child and parent-reported symptom severity in the first half of exposure sessions (Sessions 9-12), and statistically significant child-reported improvement in the second half of exposure sessions (Session 13-16). Although Cognitive Extensiveness was not associated with outcomes when analyzing the sample as a whole, age and frequency of negative automatic thoughts significantly moderated the relationship between average Cognitive Extensiveness and post-treatment clinician-rated outcomes.

AB  - This study examined individual- versus family-level mediational models that included the roles of gender, age, exposure, family relationships, and symptoms in children who were parentally bereaved during the September 11 th World Trade Center (WTC) attacks in New York City (NYC). The first model tested (Model A) hypothesized that family relationships mediated the relationship between exposure and children's symptoms. The second model tested (Model B) hypothesized that children's symptoms mediated the relationship between exposure and family relationships. Both models were tested by first controlling for gender and age (residualized mediational models), and then by stratifying by gender and age (moderated mediational models). The sample consisted of 86 children, ages 8 to 18, of emergency service personnel who died on September 11th, 2001 and was part of a larger, randomized clinical trial that examined the effects of Traumatic Grief Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Client Centered Therapy (Brown & Goodman, 2001). Participants completed measures of exposure (physical proximity, emotional proximity, and secondary adversities), family environment characteristics (cohesion and conflict), symptoms (childhood traumatic grief (CTG), anxiety, and depression), and demographic characteristics. Results supported four cases of moderated mediational models (two for younger boys and two for younger girls). In two models, family relationships mediated the relationship between secondary adversities and symptoms of CTG (Model A) and in two models, symptoms of CTG mediated the relationship between secondary adversities and family relationships (Model B). There were differential roles for family relationship variables however, with cohesion playing an important protective role for younger boys, and conflict playing an important risk role for younger girls. There was some speculative support for Model A versus Model B. The results highlight the ways in which secondary adversities may impact both the individual and family system, the importance of examining both individual- and family-level variables, and taking into account gender and age differences in studies of children. Study strengths and limitations, clinical implications, and directions for future research are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 50 children (aged 7–14 yrs) with a principal diagnosis of social phobia were randomly assigned to either child-focused cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), CBT plus parent involvement, or a wait list control (WLC). The integrated CBT program involved intensive social skills training combined with graded exposure and cognitive challenging. At posttreatment, significantly fewer children in the treatment conditions retained a clinical diagnosis of social phobia compared to the WLC condition. In comparison to the WLC, children in both CBT interventions showed significantly greater reductions in children's social and general anxiety and a significant increase in parental ratings of child social skills performance. At 12-mo follow-up, both treatment groups retained their improvement. There was a trend towards superior results when parents were involved in treatment, but this effect was not statistically significant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study explored a potentially important intersection between behavior therapy and attachment theory in the treatment of separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Specifically, in this article, the authors describe an intervention that incorporated attachment theory in the framework of an exposure-based cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for severe separation anxiety experienced by a 9-year-old boy. Assessment measures indicated that treatment gains were evident at the end of 12 sessions and that the child showed continued improvement at a 6-month follow-up session. Overall, it seemed that an attachment perspective was helpful in framing an understanding of SAD for the parent and fostering compliance with the CBT regimen. Utilization of the theory also helped the parent and therapist in determining reinforcers for the child's behavior. More detailed and controlled investigations of the effect and relative effect of the attachment focus during CBT for SAD are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anxiety disorders, including social phobia, occur often in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD; Gillott, Furniss, & Walter, 2001; Leyfer et al., 2006; Simonoff et al., 2008); however, little is known about the conceptualization and treatment of social phobia in this population. The current study presents the case of 'James,' a 6-year-old male with comorbid Asperger's disorder and social phobia. A cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) package, including parent training, psychoeducation, graduated exposure, and reinforced practice, was implemented to decrease avoidance behaviors in social settings. Results showed that James's avoidance behaviors were reduced significantly following intervention, suggesting that a CBT approach may be effective in treating social phobia in children with ASD. The significant influence of CBT on decreasing avoidance behavior in comorbid social phobia and ASD highlights the need for continued investigation of adapting CBT for use with children with ASD.

AB  - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the general notion that a psychological disorder is caused or maintained by 'dysfunctional' patterns of thoughts and behaviours (e.g. Beck et al, 1979). That is, the disorder is conceptualised as resulting at least in part from the individual's cognitive distortions (such as false attributions or expectations about the self, others or the world) that then undermine positive coping or problem-solving behaviour. CBT has its roots in behaviour therapy, which applies learning theory to psychological problems; for example, using 'exposure' to overcome avoidance of anxiety-provoking stimuli, and 'response prevention' to minimise compulsive behaviours. To date many CBT treatments with younger populations have been predominantly behavioural in content. Recently, however, there have been exciting developments in the understanding of cognitive aspects of psychological problems in childhood. In addition, recent models have begun to incorporate the maintaining role of environmental influences. For example, in Rapee's (2001) model of the development of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), parental reaction and factors associated with socialisation are hypothesised to promote the expression of anxious vulnerability in young people. As cognitive and behavioural models of childhood disorder become further refined, so will treatments, leading to greater specificity of treatments to particular disorders and a clearer understanding of how best to include families in treatment. This chapter examines the use of CBT with children and adolescents by discussing the following topics: developmental issues in CBT; whether the basic cognitive model applies to children; and, an overview of CBT with young people.

AB  - Anxiety disorders in childhood are common, debilitating, costly, and treatable. Cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely researched and exposure to feared stimuli is an effective treatment component. Previous research suggests that CBT and exposure are not provided consistently for adult anxiety disorders, but little is known about the treatment received by children in nonresearch settings. The current study examined the clinical documentation for 482 treatment sessions received by 86 youth ages 7–17 with an anxiety disorder. Treatment was delivered as part of nonresearch clinical practice within a large medical center including an anxiety specialty clinic, general mental health clinic, and primary care. Treatment sessions most frequently contained non-CBT interventions (45.4%), followed by exposure (35.1%), other CBT components (34.2%), and medication management (17.8%). The content of treatment was dependent on the setting in which it was delivered, with the majority of children seen outside the anxiety specialty clinic never introduced to exposure (76.1%). The results suggest that despite its demonstrated efficacy, exposure is underutilized for child anxiety disorders in nonresearch clinical settings.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy is regarded as a particularly effective approach to treating anxiety disorders, but is limited in that it emphasizes dysfunction and ignores the existence of a conscious self. Flow, a state achieved by an individual when his or her perceived skills are equivalent to the challenges presented by a particular situation, incorporates individuals' strengths and the conscious self into its theory. Flow can be conceptualized as a state of optimal functioning People in a state of flow achieve a sense of complete control, are totally absorbed in their activities, and typically lose all sense of time, place, and self. Subjective well-being and self-esteem have been positively correlated with the amount of time spent in flow, and flow deprivation has been shown to produce anxiety symptoms. Thus, incorporating flow into cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders might prove advantageous in that it could (a) potentially correct for some limitations of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, (b) provide clinicians with alternate ways of conceptualizing their clients' issues, symptoms, and strengths, and (c) introduce specific strategies to enhance and complement cognitive-behavioral techniques. This manual provides suggested guidelines for integrating flow with cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of anxiety. Flow can be assessed in clinical treatment using the Experience-Sampling Method or less formal measures, and cognitive-behavioral case formulations can be expanded to include flow. Flow can be incorporated into several cognitive-behavioral techniques, including cognitive restructuring, activity monitoring and scheduling, pie charts, distraction, relaxation, imagery techniques, and graded exposure. Outcome can be measured using client-driven or objective measures. The guidelines set forth in the manual have not been applied to clinical cases. Research is needed to refine the methods described and to determine their efficacy. Suggested future clinical applications of flow include using flow in both individual and child and family therapy to treat conditions such as depression and eating disorders.

AB  - This chapter is a case study of a child with multiple anxiety disorders. After the case presentation the chapter continues with three commentaries. The first commentary (Psychotherapeutic Perspective, by Bruce F. Chorpita) states that the primary treatment plan for the client would involve a cognitive-behavioral intervention (Chorpita 2007) with a focus on those treatment strategies most commonly associated with successful treatments of phobias (see Chorpita et al. 2005). The sceond commentary (Psychopharmacologic Perspective, by Daniel Pine) states that the first step in appropriate treatment for pediatric anxiety disorders is to collect more information to arrive at a more definitive diagnosis, including all relevant target disorders. As noted above, the client may manifest symptoms of many possible anxiety disorders, in addition to specific phobia. The third commentary (Integrative Perspective, by Wendy K. Silverman and Carla E. Mann) states that the client and his mother participated in a 14-week CBT program. CBT is the primary choice of treatment for anxiety disorders and phobias because of its efficacious outcome (Silverman and Kurtines 2005; Silverman et al. 2008). The main components of CBT are graduated exposure to the feared object or event, contingency management, and cognitive restructuring. The aim of the graduated exposure approach was to gradually increase the client's food intake to solid foods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Separation Anxiety Disorder is one of the most frequent mental disorders in children. The separation anxiety family treatment program (SAFT) is the only known cognitive behavioral therapy program for children with separation anxiety and their families. The first part consists of four weekly sessions with the child and four weekly sessions with the parents. Children and parents receive psychoeducation about anxiety, learn to recognize and reframe irrational beliefs about separation situations, expand their repertoire of coping strategies, and are introduced to the rationale for exposure. The second part of the treatment consists of eight weekly family sessions followed by a short parent-only session. During the family sessions, in vivo exposure is planned and put into place. The parent-only portions of the family sessions involve reframing parental irrational beliefs about separation, developing parenting strategies, and practicing parental behavior during exposure. An existing study shows the efficacy of the disorder-specific family-based therapy in comparison to waitlist controls in young children with separation anxiety disorder.

AB  - Interest in culturally specific factors in social anxiety disorder (SAD) arose from its integration into the nosology of psychopathology. We took up this question in the treatment of SAD with an immigrant patient. Taking into consideration that issues related to immigration can enhance vulnerability to SAD, we developed a cognitive-behavioral therapy that addressed the cultural elements involved in the emergence of SAD with this patient. In this case study, the therapeutic elements characteristic of the patient’s situation are analyzed in light of current research conducted on SAD. Loubna, aged 16 and Algerian born, developed a SAD upon her arrival in France. The loss of her parental figures and her protective family environment precipitated the onset of symptoms. Bögels et al. (2001) [3] have specifically studied parenting behaviors that enhance the emergence of SAD. They have highlighted the need for a specific therapeutic action, which includes the whole family in the treatment of SAD in children and adolescents. We described these parental attitudes and the ways of therapeutic action. In this case, we also looked at the link between shyness and social anxiety. Chavira et al. (2002) [4] described shyness as a risk factor for the onset of SAD. Even though early signs of shyness can be identified in Loubna’s childhood, she only developed this disorder in her adolescence. We tried to observe this transition in relation to literature analyzing this link. After a description of the therapeutic process established for Loubna, we focused our attention on the behavioral work carried out on the reduction of avoidances (avoidances of social experiences and gaze avoidance). Indeed, Horley et al. (2003) [15] identified that patients with social anxiety tend to avoid facial signals during their social interactions. The therapeutic process was designed to reduce this tendency in Loubna’s case. On the other hand, Hoffman (2004) [16] showed that therapeutic intervention based on cognitive biases interpretation of patients with social phobia is more effective in maintaining long-term therapeutic benefits than therapy treatment based only on exposure. Therefore, we correlated the increase of social experiences with the cognitive work focusing on raising positive cognitions in social situations. The therapeutic process is described as well as the evolution of Loubna’s cognitions. At the end of the cognitive and behavioral therapy, the benefits were evaluated. In addition to a significant reduction in phobic symptoms, measurements throughout therapy showed positive changes in social cognition. Loubna’s attention was more focused on detection of emotion on other people’s faces. The focus of this therapy was the inclusion of culturally specific factors. Shore and Rapport (1998) [26] found different levels of social anxiety across cultures, with a range of variable social fears. Throughout the cognitive-behavioral therapy, we analyzed these cultural elements, which facilitated and weakened Loubna’s treatment. After 8 months of therapy, Loubna’s SAD went from severe to moderate and the patient was able to join a training course. Her interpersonal skills improved and she succeeded in expanding her social network. This therapy has emphasized the complementary nature of cognitive and behavioral approaches to achieve a significant reduction in SAD symptoms. The behavioral work helped reduce fear of others through exposure, and the cognitive restructuring work led to the emergence of protective schemas in interactive situations. This case study also illustrates the need to take into account the combination of individual, family, social and cultural factors in the analysis and treatment of children and adolescents with SAD.

AB  - Objective: Exposure tasks are recognized widely as a key component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for child and adolescent anxiety. However, little research has examined specific exposure characteristics that predict outcomes for youth with anxiety and that may guide its application in therapy. Method: This study draws on a sample of 279 children and adolescents (48.4% male; 79.6% white) with a principal anxiety disorder who received 14 sessions of CBT, either alone or in combination with medication, through the Child/adolescent Anxiety Multimodal treatment Study (CAMS). The present study examines therapist-reported quantity, difficulty level, compliance, and mastery of exposure tasks as they related to CBT response (i.e., Clinical Global Impressions−Improvement ratings). Secondary treatment outcomes included reduction in anxiety symptom severity on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, global impairment measured via the Children’s Global Assessment Scale, and parent-report of anxiety-specific functional impairment on the Child Anxiety Impairment Scale. Results: Regression analyses indicated a dose–response relationship between therapist-reported quantity of exposure and independent evaluations of treatment outcome, with more time devoted to exposure linked to better outcomes. Similarly, greater time spent on more difficult (rather than mild or moderate) exposure tasks predicted better outcomes, as did therapist ratings of child compliance and mastery. Conclusion: The present findings highlight the importance of challenging children and adolescents with difficult exposure tasks and of collaborating to ensure compliance and mastery.

AB  - Developmental factors direct optimal implementations of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols with children and adolescents. Although chronological age can approximate level of development, youthful clients benefit when clinicians carefully assess each child's cognitive, social, and emotional skills and adjust manualized treatments accordingly. Using several components of manualized CBT for anxiety in youth (i.e., affective education, cognitive restructuring, exposure tasks) as a framework, this article reviews empirical literature and provides practical suggestions for modifying these aspects of treatment to fit a child's level of development. Important issues such as engaging youth in treatment, and involving school personnel and parents in this process are also discussed. This article concludes with a call for future research that will inform the implementation of manualized treatments based on developmental factors.

AB  - Objective: The essential feature of specific phobia is a persistent fear of clearly discernable, circumscribed objects or situations. The DSM-IV distinguishes four subtypes: animal, natural environment, blood-injection-injury, and situational. Specific phobias frequently co-occur. Specific phobia is one of the most common psychiatric disorders with a lifetime prevalence of 12.5% and is about twice as common in women as in men. Most phobias have a childhood onset except for the situational subtype which usually occurs during patients’ twenties. It is well known that childhood anxiety increases the risk of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety in later life, as well as the risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalization. Nonetheless, there are few studies on the psychobiology and pharmacotherapy of specific phobias. Neuroimaging studies have shown that specific phobia seems to be associated with amygdala (more specifically the right amygdala) and anterior cingulate cortex hyperactivation that is reduced after exposure therapy. The aim of this study is to propose the first systematic review of specific phobia treatment among children. Method: The review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Two databases (Medline and Web of Science) were searched combining the search terms: specific phobia and treatment. English and French language were imposed. There were no publication date or publication status limitations. Seventy-four studies met the inclusion criteria and 36 were included. Results: The goal of treatment is to achieve habituation and eventual extinction of the phobic reaction. Treatments for children’s anxiety have been suggested to work through diverse processes such as counter-conditioning, extinction, habituation, change in catastrophic cognitions, development of coping skills, increased self-efficacy, emotional processing, and changes in expectancies and perceptions of dangerousness. Most phobias respond robustly to in vivo exposure, but this approach is associated with high dropout rates and low treatment acceptance. One Session Treatment, a variant of cognitive-behavioral therapy, combines graduated in vivo exposure, participant modeling, reinforcement, psychoeducation, cognitive challenges, and skills training in an intensive treatment model. The limited data available on medication shows little promise. Finally, relapse is a common phenomenon, and little is known on the long-term outcome of the illness.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate changes in the trajectory of youth anxiety following the introduction of specific cognitive–behavior therapy (CBT) components: relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, and exposure tasks. Method: Four hundred eighty-eight youths ages 7–17 years (50% female; 74% ≤ 12 years) were randomly assigned to receive either CBT, sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or pill placebo (PBO) as part of their participation in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). Youths in the CBT conditions were evaluated weekly by therapists using the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S; Guy, 1976) and the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983) and every 4 weeks by blind independent evaluators (IEs) using the Pediatric Anxiety Ratings Scale (PARS; RUPP Anxiety Study Group, 2002). Youths in SRT and PBO were included as controls. Results: Longitudinal discontinuity analyses indicated that the introduction of both cognitive restructuring (e.g., changing self-talk) and exposure tasks significantly accelerated the rate of progress on measures of symptom severity and global functioning moving forward in treatment; the introduction of relaxation training had limited impact. Counter to expectations, no strategy altered the rate of progress in the specific domain of anxiety that it was intended to target (i.e., somatic symptoms, anxious self-talk, avoidance behavior). Conclusions: Findings support CBT theory and suggest that cognitive restructuring and exposure tasks each make substantial contributions to improvement in youth anxiety. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - What is the public health significance of this article?—The present findings suggest that cognitive restructuring and exposure tasks are critical components of CBT for youth anxiety but that relaxation training may have relatively less impact. These findings may be used to inform future efforts to make treatment more potent and efficient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Multilevel growth analysis was used to establish the shape of change (mean growth trajectory) for youth- and therapist-rated alliance in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxious youth and to identify between-youth predictors of alliance trajectory. Youth (N = 69; ages 7–17; 52.2% female) and their parents participated in an empirically supported CBT protocol. Therapists rated alliance each session and youth every four sessions. Data were fit to four growth models: linear, quadratic, a dual slope, and a novel 'alliance rupture' model. Two-level models were estimated to examine the effect of youth age, sex, pretreatment symptom severity, diagnostic comorbidity, early treatment factors (use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), and coping styles (engagement, disengagement, and involuntary coping). A dual slope model fit therapist data best, whereas youth data did not evidence systematic growth. Two-level growth models identified that pretreatment anxiety severity predicted higher initial alliance levels. Depressive symptoms predicted less linear growth and engagement coping predicted greater growth during exposure sessions. No variables predicted preexposure growth. In the therapist model, 22% of initial alliance, 50% of preexposure growth, and 75% of postexposure growth were accounted for by between youth variables (mood disorder, anxiety and depression symptoms, engagement and involuntary coping). Therapist-reported alliance ratings may grow over the course of manual-based CBT, even during exposure-focused sessions. Pretreatment youth factors and coping style may influence the absolute value and linear trajectory of alliance during CBT. Findings about alliance-influencing factors can help set expectations for, and enhance training in, empirically supported treatments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The recent wave of terrorism affecting the US and other countries raises concerns about the welfare of children and adolescents. This review first summarizes data from studies that examine the psychiatric consequences of childhood exposure to trauma, with emphasis on identifying factors that predict psychiatric outcome. Prior studies suggest that level of exposure, evidence of psychopathology before trauma exposure, and disruption in social support networks consistently emerge as strong predictors of psychopathology following trauma exposure. Clinicians might monitor children exposed to trauma most closely when they present with these risk factors. Second, randomized controlled trials document the beneficial effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in children exposed to sexual abuse. When combined with other data from open studies and controlled trials in nontraumatized children, these studies suggest that CBT is an option for children developing anxiety symptoms following the recent terrorism. In terms of psychopharmacological treatments, data from randomized controlled trials in traumatized children have not been generated, but recent studies in other children with symptoms of anxiety or depression suggest the utility of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

AB  - This article explores migration trauma among Mexican and Central American unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) with the purpose of developing an understanding of migration as a tripartite process consisting of: pre-migration exposure to traumatic stressors, in-journey stressors, and post-migration stressors. The migration experience of these youth may be subjectively different depending on a wide range of factors. The complexities of migration are explored as a traumatic, tripartite process. These three salient components of migration may act as precursors, often resulting in psychological sequelae such as: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Of all migrant groups, URM are more likely to develop psychiatric symptoms. Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS), and Mental Health for Immigrants Program (MHIP) are among the most effective interventions in the treatment of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in refugee minors. Social workers in schools are in unique positions to provide mental health services to URM. A case example illustrating a cultural adaptation of TF-CBT in an urban public high school is included. Clinical implications of culturally responsive and trauma-informed treatment of URM in schools will be discussed. Additionally, this article will emphasize the importance of bridging the gap between research and culturally responsive, trauma-informed interventions for URM in schools.

AB  - Many youth experience ongoing trauma exposure, such as domestic or community violence. Clinicians often ask whether evidence-based treatments containing exposure components to reduce learned fear responses to historical trauma are appropriate for these youth. Essentially the question is, if youth are desensitized to their trauma experiences, will this in some way impair their responding to current or ongoing trauma? The paper addresses practical strategies for implementing one evidence-based treatment, Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for youth with ongoing traumas. Collaboration with local therapists and families participating in TF-CBT community and international programs elucidated effective strategies for applying TF-CBT with these youth. These strategies included: (1) enhancing safety early in treatment; (2) effectively engaging parents who experience personal ongoing trauma; and (3) during the trauma narrative and processing component focusing on (a) increasing parental awareness and acceptance of the extent of the youths’ ongoing trauma experiences; (b) addressing youths’ maladaptive cognitions about ongoing traumas; and (c) helping youth differentiate between real danger and generalized trauma reminders. Case examples illustrate how to use these strategies in diverse clinical situations. Through these strategies TF-CBT clinicians can effectively improve outcomes for youth experiencing ongoing traumas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) addresses problems specifically associated with significantly traumatic events that children experience or witness. The prototypical disorder associated with trauma exposure is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); TF-CBT targets PTSD symptoms, as well as other trauma-related outcomes. After trauma exposure, many children develop significant PTSD symptoms without meeting full PTSD diagnostic criteria, and these children are also appropriate candidates for TF-CBT treatment. DSM-5 PTSD includes negative cognitions about oneself, others, and/or the world (e.g., shame, self-blame, poor self-esteem, diminished sense of safety or trust), as well as negative affective states (e.g., sadness, anger). Research has demonstrated that traumatized children may experience dysregulation in affective, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological areas of functioning. Some children may develop depressive, anxiety, behavioral, or physical disorders in response to trauma exposure rather than PTSD. These problems are addressed in greater detail elsewhere.

AB  - This chapter describes therapy that is specifically targeted toward traumatized children. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) addresses problems specifically associated with significantly traumatic events that children experience or witness. Traumatic events are those that are terrifying, shocking, sudden, and potentially threatening to life, safety, or physical integrity. These may include but are not limited to experiences such as sexual or physical abuse or assault, domestic or community violence, bullying, serious accidents, natural or other disasters, fires, traumatic deaths, war, terrorism, and medical traumas. The prototypical disorder associated with trauma exposure is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); TF-CBT targets PTSD symptoms as well as other trauma-related outcomes. After trauma exposure many children develop significant PTSD symptoms without meeting full PTSD diagnostic criteria, and these children are also appropriate candidates for TF-CBT treatment. Other children may develop depressive, anxiety, or behavioral or physical disorders in response to trauma exposure rather than PTSD. Still others may have changed cognitions about themselves, others, and the world (e.g., shame, self-blame, poor self-esteem, diminished sense of safety or trust). Research has demonstrated that traumatized children may experience dysregulation in affective, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological areas of functioning. TF-CBT includes components that target reregulation in each of these realms, with a goal of optimizing children's adaptive functioning after trauma. TF-CBT is thus intended for children who have primary trauma symptoms (e.g., PTSD, depressive, anxiety, shame, cognitive distortions) that the core components of this model would be expected to improve. The core target of TF-CBT is to help children overcome traumatic avoidance, shame, sadness, fear, and other trauma-specific problems. Goals and themes of TF-CBT include (1) mastering skills to manage stress and improve affective, behavioral, and cognitive regulation early in treatment; (2) inclusion of parents or other care-taking adults in treatment whenever feasible; (3) mastering trauma reminders and traumatic avoidance through the use of GE throughout the TFT-CBT model; (4) making meaning and contextualizing traumatic experiences through affective and cognitive processing—moving beyond victimization; and (5) enhancing safety and optimizing future development.

AB  - A manualised trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) programme was developed for multiply-abused children diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Feather & Ronan, 2004). It was piloted with 4 children (aged 9-14 years) referred to a specialist clinic of the statutory child protection agency. The locally developed programme built on efficacious treatments for childhood anxiety and PTSD as a result of sexual abuse. It comprises psychosocial strengthening, coping skills training, gradual exposure using creative media, and special issues relevant to trauma and abuse. A multiple baseline design was used to demonstrate the controlling effects of the treatment. The results indicate a good deal of promise. PTSD symptoms generally decreased and child coping increased. Gains improved over 3, 6, and 12 month follow-ups. Results are discussed in terms of the value of clinicians engaging in local research aimed at increasing outcomes for their clients.

AB  - Background: The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) in inner city schools, when delivered by novice CBT clinicians, and compared to usual care (UC), is unknown. Objective: This pilot study addressed this issue by comparing a modular CBT for anxiety disorders to UC in a sample of 32 volunteer youth (mean age 10.28 years, 63% female, 84% African American) seen in school-based mental health programs. Methods: Youth were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 17) or UC (n = 15); independent evaluators conducted diagnostic interviews with children and parents at pre- and post-intervention, and at a one-month follow-up. Results: Based on intent-to-treat analyses, no differences were found in response rates between groups with 50 and 42% of the children in CBT, compared to 46 and 57% in UC no longer meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder at post-treatment and follow-up respectively. Similar improvements in global functioning were also found in both treatment groups. Baseline predictors of a positive treatment response included lower anxiety, fewer maladaptive thoughts, less exposure to urban hassles, and lower levels of parenting stress. Therapist use of more CBT session structure elements and greater competence in implementing these elements was also related to a positive treatment response. Conclusions: Findings from this small pilot failed to show that CBT was superior to UC when delivered by school-based clinicians. Large scale comparative effectiveness trials are needed to determine whether CBT leads to superior clinical outcomes prior to dissemination.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has blossomed in the last 15 years into an empirically supported treatment for this often disabling condition, with randomized studies from around the world attesting to its efficacy relative to various comparison conditions and to active medication. As applied to OCD, the exposure principle relies on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus that is not inherently dangerous. Thus, a child with fear of germs must confront fear-evoking but objectively low-risk situations and allow his or her anxiety to decrease naturally over time. Repeated exposure is associated with decreased anxiety across exposure trials (between-session habituation), with anxiety reduction largely specific to the domain of exposure, until the child no longer fears contact with specifically targeted phobic stimuli. As is the case in treatment studies for adults suffering from OCD, the effects of CBT for youth appear to be both robust and durable, with the follow-up studies we have available indicating that the effects of treatment last for up to 9 months after treatment has ended. Approximately 12-14 weekly treatments appear to be sufficient for most patients, although future studies should examine whether symptom severity, comorbidity, readiness for change, and case complexity (e.g., family problems) necessitate more intensive approaches. The degree of family involvement and the degree to which this involvement needs to target specific family predictors of poorer response (e.g., accommodation) also remains an issue in need of more study.

AB  - Selective mutism is a rare, debilitating condition usually seen in children. Unfortunately, there is little research examining effective treatments for this disorder, and designing an evidence-based treatment plan can be difficult. This case study presents the evidence-based treatment of an 8-year-old Caucasian boy with selective mutism using an established treatment for anxiety—Modular Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Childhood Anxiety Disorders (Chorpita, 2007). The treatment consisted of 21 sessions and included modules on psychoeducation, exposure, cognitive restructuring, social skills, and maintenance and relapse prevention. The client's symptoms were greatly improved by the end of treatment based on fear hierarchy ratings, self-report and parent-report questionnaires, and child and parent clinical interviews. In addition, at discharge the client no longer met criteria for selective mutism. Improvements were maintained when the client was reassessed at 1-month and 6-month follow-up appointments.

AB  - Research on the relationship between therapist adherence and treatment outcome in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has yielded mixed findings (e.g., Webb et al., 2012). A new avenue for clarifying this relationship is to examine the relationship between adherence and symptom change at 'critical sessions' in therapy. Sudden gains (SGs) and sudden regressions (SRs), which refer to large, stable symptom change occurring between two consecutive treatment sessions, may represent critical sessions in therapy, as they have been associated with treatment outcome among adults and children with various psychological disorders (e.g., Aderka et al., 2012; Conklin, Wyszynski & Chu, submitted for publication). The current study uses observational coding to assess the relationship between therapist extensiveness (a dimensional adherence construct), child involvement in session, and SGs/SRs during CBT for youth anxiety. Participants include 68 youth (ages 8 -- 17 years) with a principal anxiety disorder diagnosis who were treated in an open efficacy trial of the Coping Cat, a manual-based CBT protocol (Kendall & Hedtke, 2006). Therapist extensiveness of four key Coping Cat interventions (i.e., relaxation, exposure, cognitive restructuring, and problem-solving) was assessed via observational coding, and child involvement in therapy sessions was assessed via therapist report (CIRS). Client symptom change across treatment sessions was measured by symptom report (STAIC) at each therapy session. It was hypothesized that greater therapist extensiveness would predict and be predicted by SGs, while lower therapist extensiveness would predict and be predicted by SRs. It was also hypothesized that SGs would predict greater child involvement while SRs would predict reduced child involvement. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that total therapist extensiveness predicted SGs at the trend level, while extensiveness did not predict SRs. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that SGs predicted significantly greater therapist exposure extensiveness and overall extensiveness in the next session. SRs predicted greater therapist cognitive restructuring extensiveness at the trend level. Methodological limitations, such as insufficient power to detect significant effects, recommendations for future research, and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Selective Mutism (SM) is an impairing behavioral condition in which a child fails to speak in certain social situations despite speaking regularly and normally in other situations. SM presents a significant mental and public health problem due to impact on the social, emotional, and academic functioning of young children at a critical point in their development. SM is closely related to childhood social phobia, but it cannot be treated in the same way because of the young age of the children affected, their lack of speech in the treatment setting, and the need for significant school involvement in treatment. Treatment for Children with Selective Mutism outlines the sequence and essential elements to guide clinicians through a comprehensive, integrated program for young children who display symptoms of SM. This approach utilizes behavioral interventions targeting gradual increases in speaking across settings in which the child initially has difficulty. The integrated nature of the therapy refers to the goal of incorporating input from the clinician with that from the parents and teacher, as well as others impacted by the lack of speech. Exposure exercises are based on behavioral techniques such as stimulus fading, shaping, and systematic desensitization that also allow for a less intense or gradual exposure to the speaking situation. These techniques are combined and used flexibly with a behavioral reward system for participation in treatment. The approach was developed by Dr. R. Lindsey Bergman as part of the UCLA Childhood OCD, Anxiety, and Tic Disorders Program. The treatment protocol consists of 20 sessions, 60 minutes each, delivered over the course of 24 weeks. Treatment for Children with Selective Mutism is an invaluable guide for mental health professionals who deliver CBT-based treatment to children and want to help those with SM.

AB  - Children displaying generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or its diagnostic precursor, overanxious disorder (OAD), experience excessive amounts of worry or anxious apprehension that cannot be reliably linked to a specific object or situation. GAD in children and adolescents has estimated prevalence rates of 2-10%. Despite the general lack of empirical validation for use with GAD children, a number of both behavioral (exposure techniques, systematic desensitization, modeling, contingent reinforcement, etc) and cognitive-behavioral techniques (cognitive-behavioral procedures for anxious children [P. C. Kendall, 1994], cognitive-behavioral therapy with family anxiety management [P. C Barrett, 1993] have been used with this population. A case example is presented with alternative conceptualizations and treatment options. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter discusses the treatment of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The case of Max demonstrated that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with exposure & response prevention (ERP) can be effective in treating comorbid OCD in a young person with ASD. While the treatment approach used in this case was intensive, the therapeutic process and outcomes would be very similar if given in standard weekly sessions. This testament produced a clinically significant reduction in OCD, anxiety and depression symptoms, while improvements were also seen in Max's quality of life and overall functioning. Max's parents were also to benefit, being able to enjoy leisurely activities together once more. With Max's distress and demands for accommodation greatly reduced, the family unit was functioning much better at conclusion of therapy. The present case highlights the importance of psychoeducation concerning family accommodation in the treatment process of pediatric OCD, particular when accommodation practices are extreme, which might be a correlate of ASD comorbidity. An important consideration when treating comorbid OCD and ASD is parental involvement in the treatment process. In clinical practice, a clear understanding of the distinctions between ASD and OCD may prevent diagnostic overshadowing, which occurs when impairing obsessions and compulsions are attributed to the diagnosis of ASD and not recognized as OCD symptoms.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of OCD emphasize fear of harm as being associated with obsessive thoughts. For example, a person might have an obsession about being contaminated by germs after touching a public doorknob. This produces distress associated with a fear of becoming terminally sick. The person then engages in a compulsion (likely hand washing), to avoid the perceived harmful outcome, thereby temporarily reducing the distress but maintaining the compulsive behavior in the long run. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for OCD. exposure and ritual prevention (ERP), creates new associations by exposing patients to their feared situations and resisting the urge to perform their compulsion. In the case presented, the patient was seen for 14 sessions of individual CBT using ERP. The patient's parents were kept abreast of the treatment including complications and progress. No full parent sessions were held. However, the patient's parents were consulted and given updates every session and met with the therapist approximately every other session, primarily to discuss how to implement exposures outside of the session.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of Internet interventions among nulliparous women suffering from severe fear of childbirth (FOC) by means of an Internet-delivered therapist-supported self-help program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). Design: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Setting: A feasibility study of an ICBT program for the treatment of severe FOC in pregnant women. Sample: Twenty-eight Swedish-speaking nulliparous women with severe FOC recruited via a project home page from January 2012 to December 2013. Methods: The main components of the ICBT program for the treatment of severe FOC comprised psycho-education, breathing retraining, cognitive restructuring, imaginary exposure, in vivo exposure and relapse prevention. The study participants were anonymously self-recruited over the Internet, interviewed by telephone and then enrolled. All participants were offered 8 weeks of treatment via the Internet. Participants reported their homework weekly, submitted measurements of their fear and received feedback from a therapist via a secure online contact management system. Main outcome measures: Level of FOC measured with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ A) during screening at enrollment and weekly during the treatment (W-DEQ version A), and after the delivery (W-DEQ version B). Results: A statistically significant (p < 0.0005) decrease of FOC [W-DEQ sum score decreased pre to post-therapy, with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.95)]. Conclusions: The results of this feasibility study suggest that ICBT has potential in the treatment of severe FOC during pregnancy in motivated nulliparous women. The results need to be confirmed by randomized controlled studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The overall goal of this chapter is to provide a case report of a successful use of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to treat primarily sexual adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The chapter intends to emphasize specific elements of exposure design and implementation that, if ignored or done incorrectly, can hinder outcome and lead clinicians to avoid utilizing CBT. Primarily, clinical experience and preliminary research supports the theory that therapists who are more prone to anxiety or disgust, in situations such as discussing sexual thoughts about a young child for example, are less likely to conduct appropriate CBT. Thus, this chapter displays the importance of therapists' non-avoidance of treating sexual obsessive-compulsive symptoms by conducting exposures that often involve explicit sexual content.

AB  - Separation Anxiety Disorder is one oft the most frequent mental disorders in children. The SAFT treatment manual is an evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for children with separation anxiety. Its first part consists of four weekly sessions with the child and four weekly sessions with the parents. Children and parents receive psychoeducation about anxiety, learn to recognize and reframe irrational beliefs about separation situations, expand their repertoire of coping strategies, and are introduced to the rationale for exposure. The second part of treatment consists of eight weekly family sessions followed by a short parent-only session. During the family sessions, exposure in vivo is planned and practiced. The parent-only portions of the family sessions involve reframing parental irrational beliefs about separation, parenting strategies and practicing parental behavior during exposure. Evaluation data shows that disorder-specific family-based therapy (SAFT) results in improvement compared with waiting list controls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is arguably the most effective psychotherapy model for children and adolescents with emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, trauma and stress-related disorders, etc.). Emotional disorders in youth frequently overlap or co-occur, and yet many of the existing, effective therapies available for children and adolescents with emotional disorders target just one or a smaller subset of these problems. The Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents, based in groundbreaking research from Jill Ehrenreich-May, David H. Barlow, and colleagues, suggest that there may be a simpler and more efficient method of utilizing effective strategies, such as those commonly included in CBT, in a manner that addresses the broad array of emotional disorder symptoms in children and adolescents. The child and adolescent Unified Protocols do this by framing effective strategies in the general language of strong or intense emotions, more broadly, and by targeting change through a common lens that applies across emotional disorders. Specifically, the child and adolescent Unified Protocols help youth by allowing them to focus on a straightforward goal across emotional disorders: reducing intense negative emotion states by extinguishing the distress and anxiety these emotions produce through emotion-focused education, awareness techniques, cognitive strategies, problem-solving and an array of behavioral strategies, including a full range of exposure and activation techniques. The Unified Protocol for children and adolescents comprises a Therapist Guide as well as two Workbooks, one for children and one for adolescents.

AB  - This paper will focus on practical approaches for effectively intervening with this group of anxious children. From a behavior therapy standpoint, mutism is a learned behavior that develops either as a means of getting attention or avoiding anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) typically encompasses the use of self-talk strategies while incorporating modeling, anxiety management, contingency management, and graded exposure therapy. Selective mutism remains a difficult disorder to treat, and no set treatment is ideal. The standard model of CBT in which children are taught to recognize and identify anxious situations and learn specific strategies to address anxiety is not sufficient with this population. Furthermore, frank discussions of the treatment process and the approach, as well as judicious utilization of medications must be discussed early on in treatment. Attention to ideographic factors and patience on the part of the therapist are also important factors in successful treatment outcome. Further studies utilizing objective measures and standardized treatment protocols should be given priority as we move forward in clarifying this complex disorder.

AB  - What is the best approach for treating patients with social phobia (social anxiety disorder) over the long term? Social phobia is the most common anxiety disorder, with reported prevalence rates of up to 18.7%. Social phobia is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of being observed or evaluated by others in social performance or interaction situations and is associated with physical, cognitive, and behavioral (ie, avoidance) symptoms. The onset of social phobia typically occurs in childhood or adolescence and the clinical course, if left untreated, is usually chronic, unremitting, and associated with significant functional impairment. Social phobia exhibits a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse/dependence. Few people with social phobia seek professional help despite the existence of beneficial treatment approaches. The efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), evidenced in randomized clinical trials, support these agents as first-line treatment. The benzodiazepine clonazepam and certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors (representing both reversible and nonreversible inhibitors) may also be of benefit. Treatment of social phobia may need to be continued for several months to consolidate response and achieve full remission. The SSRIs have shown benefit in long-term treatment trials, while long-term treatment data from clinical studies of clonazepam are limited but support the drug's efficacy. There is also evidence for the effectiveness of exposure-based strategies of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and controlled studies suggest that the effects of treatment are generally maintained at long-term follow-up. In light of the chronicity and disability associated with social phobia, as well as the high relapse rate after short-term therapy, it is recommended that effective treatment be continued for at least 12 months.

AB  - In children, adolescents and adults, anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven to be the most effective treatment with the highest evidence level for anxiety disorders in all age groups. With exposure as a key element of CBT and extinction as the underlying mechanism of exposure, most of the effectiveness of CBT has been attributed to the principle of extinction (inhibitory) learning. Considering also translational research, this article gives an overview of strategies for the enhancement of exposure-based treatments in children, adolescents, and adults. This overview includes introductions to strategies, such as massed or varied exposure, but also considers mechanisms, such as context conditioning, that increase the risk of relapse after successful therapy. A special emphasis is placed on cognitive enhancers like D-Cycloserin or cortisol that are ingested either before or after an exposure session to promote the neurological processes of extinction learning and the consolidation of extinction memory.
