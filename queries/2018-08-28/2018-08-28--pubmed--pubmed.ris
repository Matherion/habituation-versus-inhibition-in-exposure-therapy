AB  - Panic disorder (PD) can result in significant functional impairment. Studies of
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PD have demonstrated response rates
      ranging between 38 and 65%. D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial NMDA agonist, may
      enhance the effects of exposure-based therapy for PD in adults; however, no
      studies have examined its effect in adolescents with PD. This study examined the 
      feasibility and acceptability of the use of DCS to augment intensive CBT for PD
      in adolescents. Twenty-four adolescents (ages 12-17) participated in this
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, to compare CBT + DCS to CBT
      + placebo. The results demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the
      treatment to participants. No significant differences were found between the two 
      groups, but both groups showed significant improvement. This is the first
      investigation of DCS in the treatment of PD in adolescents and it provides
      initial support for a more extensive study of DCS augmentation of CBT among
      adolescents with PD.

      Advances.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1007/s11920-018-0924-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent research validating cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) as a first-line intervention for childhood anxiety disorders. We
      also review recent research aimed at enhancing exposure-based CBT components and 
      adapting CBT to work with specific populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Exposure-based
      CBT is a well-established intervention. Different research groups have found
      positive evidence to augment CBT by evaluating inhibitory learning principles,
      the role of parents in child treatment, an individualized case formulation,
      computer and online forms of CBT, and virtual and augmented reality systems for
      exposure practice. Specific programs have been developed to meet specific needs
      of preschoolers, adolescents, and children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder
      and anxiety. Successful adaptations to CBT exist and the field should continue to
      improve the generalizability, feasibility, and expected benefit of CBT to improve
      its effectiveness.

TI  - Psychological therapies for the treatment of mental disorders in low- and
      middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises.
PG  - CD011849
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011849.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People living in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income
      countries (LMICs) are exposed to a constellation of stressors that make them
      vulnerable to developing mental disorders. Mental disorders with a higher
      prevalence in these settings include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
      major depressive, anxiety, somatoform (e.g. medically unexplained physical
      symptoms (MUPS)), and related disorders. A range of psychological therapies are
      used to manage symptoms of mental disorders in this population. OBJECTIVES: To
      compare the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies versus
      control conditions (wait list, treatment as usual, attention placebo,
      psychological placebo, or no treatment) aimed at treating people with mental
      disorders (PTSD and major depressive, anxiety, somatoform, and related disorders)
      living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the 
      Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase
      (OVID), and PsycINFO (OVID), with results incorporated from searches to 3
      February 2016. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal
      (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any unpublished or ongoing studies. We
      checked the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies versus 
      control conditions (including no treatment, usual care, wait list, attention
      placebo, and psychological placebo) to treat adults and children with mental
      disorders living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane procedures for collecting data and evaluating
      risk of bias. We calculated standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes
      and risk ratios for dichotomous data, using a random-effects model. We analysed
      data at endpoint (zero to four weeks after therapy); at medium term (one to four 
      months after therapy); and at long term (six months or longer). GRADE (Grades of 
      Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to assess the
      quality of evidence for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression,
      anxiety and withdrawal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: We included 36 studies (33 RCTs)
      with a total of 3523 participants. Included studies were conducted in sub-Saharan
      Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia. Studies were implemented in
      response to armed conflicts; disasters triggered by natural hazards; and other
      types of humanitarian crises. Together, the 33 RCTs compared eight psychological 
      treatments against a control comparator.Four studies included children and
      adolescents between 5 and 18 years of age. Three studies included mixed
      populations (two studies included participants between 12 and 25 years of age,
      and one study included participants between 16 and 65 years of age). Remaining
      studies included adult populations (18 years of age or older).Included trials
      compared a psychological therapy versus a control intervention (wait list in most
      studies; no treatment; treatment as usual). Psychological therapies were
      categorised mainly as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in 23 comparisons
      (including seven comparisons focused on narrative exposure therapy (NET), two
      focused on common elements treatment approach (CETA), and one focused on brief
      behavioural activation treatment (BA)); eye movement desensitisation and
      reprocessing (EMDR) in two comparisons; interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in
      three comparisons; thought field therapy (TFT) in three comparisons; and trauma
      or general supportive counselling in two comparisons. Although interventions were
      described under these categories, several psychotherapeutic elements were common 
      to a range of therapies (i.e. psychoeducation, coping skills).In adults,
      psychological therapies may substantially reduce endpoint PTSD symptoms compared 
      to control conditions (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.07, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) -1.34 to -0.79; 1272 participants; 16 studies; low-quality
      evidence). The effect is smaller at one to four months (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.68
      to -0.31; 1660 participants; 18 studies) and at six months (SMD -0.37, 95% CI
      -0.61 to -0.14; 400 participants; five studies). Psychological therapies may also
      substantially reduce endpoint depression symptoms compared to control conditions 
      (SMD -0.86, 95% CI -1.06 to -0.67; 1254 participants; 14 studies; low-quality
      evidence). Similar to PTSD symptoms, follow-up data at one to four months showed 
      a smaller effect on depression (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.21; 1386
      participants; 16 studies). Psychological therapies may moderately reduce anxiety 
      at endpoint (SMD -0.74, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.49; 694 participants; five studies;
      low-quality evidence) and at one to four months' follow-up after treatment (SMD
      -0.53, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.39; 969 participants; seven studies). Dropout rates are
      probably similar between study conditions (19.5% with control versus 19.1% with
      psychological therapy (RR 0.98 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16; 2930 participants; 23
      studies, moderate quality evidence)).In children and adolescents, we found very
      low quality evidence for lower endpoint PTSD symptoms scores in psychotherapy
      conditions (CBT) compared to control conditions, although the confidence interval
      is wide (SMD -1.56, 95% CI -3.13 to 0.01; 130 participants; three studies;). No
      RCTs provided data on major depression or anxiety in children. The effect on
      withdrawal was uncertain (RR 1.87 95% CI 0.47 to 7.47; 138 participants; 3
      studies, low quality evidence).We did not identify any studies that evaluated
      psychological treatments on (symptoms of) somatoform disorders or MUPS in LMIC
      humanitarian settings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low quality evidence that
      psychological therapies have large or moderate effects in reducing PTSD,
      depressive, and anxiety symptoms in adults living in humanitarian settings in
      LMICs. By one to four month and six month follow-up assessments treatment effects
      were smaller. Fewer trials were focused on children and adolescents and they
      provide very low quality evidence of a beneficial effect of psychological
      therapies in reducing PTSD symptoms at endpoint. Confidence in these findings is 
      influenced by the risk of bias in the studies and by substantial levels of
      heterogeneity. More research evidence is needed, particularly for children and
      adolescents over longer periods of follow-up.

AB  - Anxiety disorders (ADs) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are
      two of the most common psychiatric disorders in youth and approximately 25% of
      those with an AD have comorbid ADHD.(1) Children with AD and ADHD evidence
      greater impairment than those with either disorder alone, making them a
      particularly vulnerable population in need of effective treatment.(2) Although a 
      strong evidence base supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      for treating anxiety in children,(3) there is little information to guide
      practitioners on how to best treat those dually diagnosed with an AD and ADHD.
      Questions have arisen as to whether the cognitive, attentional, and behavioral
      impairments associated with ADHD interfere with the ability of these children to 
      benefit from CBT for anxiety.(4) Does the distractibility and overactivity
      characteristic of ADHD inhibit, perhaps differentially, the ability of these
      children to effectively engage in CBT for anxiety (e.g., psychoeducation,
      cognitive restructuring, therapeutic exposure)?

AB  - Exposure therapy is a highly effective, evidence-based treatment technique for
      children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Regardless, therapists in the
      community are reported to use exposure relatively rarely compared with other
      approaches. The goal of the present study was to identify how practicing
      clinicians treat youth with anxiety disorders across the United States and what
      factors contribute to their use of exposure therapy. Recruited from public
      directories, 257 private practice therapists who treat anxious youth were
      surveyed. Non-exposure cognitive-behavioral techniques like cognitive
      restructuring and relaxation techniques were used significantly more frequently
      than exposure. Providers with more training in exposure therapy and fewer
      negative beliefs about this approach reported using exposure significantly more
      in the treatment of youth with social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and panic
      disorders. Self-identification as an anxiety disorder specialist significantly
      predicted exposure use for youth with posttraumatic stress disorder. Most
      therapists in private practice have minimal training in exposure therapy,
      perceive a lack of training options, and believe there would be a benefit to
      acquiring more training. The implications of these findings are discussed,
      including how to optimally design training opportunities in exposure therapy.

TI  - Open Trial of Modular Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment of Anxiety
      Among Late Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
LID - 10.1007/s10578-018-0817-5 [doi]
AB  - Given the high rates of comorbid anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in
      the adolescent and young adult population, effective treatment protocols to
      address anxiety symptoms are of importance to help promote greater independence
      across settings. While research supports the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) across younger age groups with ASD, the literature is limited on
      interventions benefitting adolescents and young adults with comorbid anxiety
      disorders and ASD. Therefore, this open trial utilized a modified CBT manual for 
      seven participants between the ages of 16 and 20 years, consisting of a 16-week
      modularized CBT treatment, including psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, and
      exposure therapy. Measures of anxiety and depression were completed at baseline
      and post-treatment. Findings demonstrated significant reductions on
      clinician-rated measures of anxiety. While findings are encouraging, additional
      studies examining the efficacy of CBT for this population with ASD and clinical
      anxiety are necessary to further identify beneficial treatment components.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders 
      including autism, Asperger's syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental
      disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The new diagnostic criteria of ASD
      focuses on two core domains: social communication impairment and restricted
      interests/repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been steadily
      increasing over the past two decades, with current estimates reaching up to 1 in 
      36 children. Hereditary factors, parental history of psychiatric disorders,
      pre-term births, and fetal exposure to psychotropic drugs or insecticides have
      all been linked to higher risk of ASD. Several scales such as the Childhood
      Autism Rating Scale (CARS), The Autism Spectrum Disorder-Observation for Children
      (ASD-OC), The Developmental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview (3di), are
      available to aid in better assessing the behaviors and symptoms associated with
      ASD. Nearly 75% of ASD patients suffer from comorbid psychiatric illnesses or
      conditions, which may include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
      anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, Tourette syndrome, and others. Both
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for ASD.
      Pharmacological treatments include psychostimulants, atypical antipsychotics,
      antidepressants, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. These medications
      provide partial symptomatic relief of core symptoms of ASD or manage the symptoms
      of comorbid conditions. Non-pharmacological interventions, which show promising
      evidence in improving social interaction and verbal communication of ASD
      patients, include music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and social
      behavioral therapy. Hormonal therapies with oxytocyin or vasopressin receptor
      antagonists have also shown some promise in improving core ASD symptoms. The use 
      of vitamins, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements in conjunction with
      pharmacological and behavioral treatment appear to have some effect in
      symptomatic improvement in ASD, though additional studies are needed to confirm
      these benefits. Developing novel disease-modifying therapies may prove to be the 
      ultimate intervention for sustained improvement of symptoms in ASD.

TI  - Using Mobile Health Gamification to Facilitate Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      Skills Practice in Child Anxiety Treatment: Open Clinical Trial.
PG  - e9
LID - 10.2196/games.8902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy is an efficacious treatment for child
      anxiety disorders. Although efficacious, many children (40%-50%) do not show a
      significant reduction in symptoms or full recovery from primary anxiety
      diagnoses. One possibility is that they are unwilling to learn and practice
      cognitive behavioral therapy skills beyond therapy sessions. This can occur for a
      variety of reasons, including a lack of motivation, forgetfulness, and a lack of 
      cognitive behavioral therapy skills understanding. Mobile health (mHealth)
      gamification provides a potential solution to improve cognitive behavioral
      therapy efficacy by delivering more engaging and interactive strategies to
      facilitate cognitive behavioral therapy skills practice in everyday lives (in
      vivo). OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project was to redesign an existing mHealth
      system called SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment) so as to
      increase user engagement, retention, and learning facilitation by integrating
      gamification techniques and interactive features. Furthermore, this project
      assessed the effectiveness of gamification in improving user engagement and
      retention throughout posttreatment. METHODS: We redesigned and implemented the
      SmartCAT system consisting of a smartphone app for children and an integrated
      clinician portal. The gamified app contains (1) a series of interactive games and
      activities to reinforce skill understanding, (2) an in vivo skills coach that
      cues the participant to use cognitive behavioral therapy skills during real-world
      emotional experiences, (3) a home challenge module to encourage home-based
      exposure tasks, (4) a digital reward system that contains digital points and
      trophies, and (5) a therapist-patient messaging interface. Therapists used a
      secure Web-based portal connected to the app to set up required activities for
      each session, receive or send messages, manage participant rewards and
      challenges, and view data and figures summarizing the app usage. The system was
      implemented as an adjunctive component to brief cognitive behavioral therapy in
      an open clinical trial. To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification, we
      compared the app usage data at posttreatment with the earlier version of SmartCAT
      without gamification. RESULTS: Gamified SmartCAT was used frequently throughout
      treatment. On average, patients spent 35.59 min on the app (SD 64.18) completing 
      13.00 activities between each therapy session (SD 12.61). At the 0.10
      significance level, the app usage of the gamified system (median 68.00) was
      higher than that of the earlier, nongamified SmartCAT version (median 37.00,
      U=76.00, P<.01). The amount of time spent on the gamified system (median 173.15) 
      was significantly different from that of the earlier version (median 120.73,
      U=173.00, P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: The gamified system showed good acceptability,
      usefulness, and engagement among anxious children receiving brief cognitive
      behavioral therapy treatment. Integrating an mHealth gamification platform within
      treatment for anxious children seems to increase involvement in shorter
      treatment. Further study is needed to evaluate increase in involvement in
      full-length treatment.

      frequency, clinical correlates, and treatment response.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/09638237.2018.1466034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood anxiety disorders are common in early childhood and are
      associated with marked impairment. Family accommodation, which contributes to the
      maintenance of child anxiety, has only been minimally examined in children under 
      the age of 7 years with anxiety disorders. AIMS: This study aimed at examining
      the frequency and clinical correlates of family accommodation in anxious children
      under the age of 7 years, as well as changes in family accommodation following
      cognitive-behavioral treatment. METHOD: Twenty-six children between the ages of 4
      and 7 years diagnosed with at least one anxiety disorder participated in this
      study. A subsample of these children (n = 23) participated in 10 sessions of
      parent-led exposure therapy or treatment-as-usual (TAU). RESULTS: Family
      accommodation occurred in 100% of the sample and was positively correlated with
      children's externalizing behavior, but not with anxiety severity or parental
      distress. Family accommodation decreased following cognitive behavioral therapy
      but not TAU. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in family accommodation were associated with
      greater improvements in child anxiety symptoms following treatment.

      review for practitioners.
PG  - 23-35
LID - 10.21037/tp.2017.08.05 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders are common in children and adolescents with reported prevalence
      rates between 10% and 30%. A combined approach to treatment has been found to be 
      the most effective for optimal outcomes and is typically comprised of
      psychotherapy (especially exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy), family and 
      patient education, and use of medication if indicated. In children and
      adolescents who might benefit from use of medications, selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drugs of choice. The safety and efficacy of
      medications other than SSRIs in the treatment of children and adolescents with
      anxiety disorders are not fully established. Most children and adolescents
      respond well to treatment with long lasting resolution of symptoms, although,
      recurrence of the same, or development of a different type of anxiety disorder,
      is not uncommon. In most children and adolescents, anxiety disorders tend to
      persist into adulthood requiring long-term treatment planning. This paper reviews
      the pharmacological agents used in the treatment of anxiety disorders in children
      and adolescents.

      Dental Anxiety: Open Trial.
PG  - e12
LID - 10.2196/jmir.7803 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based method for
      treating specific phobias, but access to treatment is difficult, especially for
      children and adolescents with dental anxiety. Psychologist-guided Internet-based 
      CBT (ICBT) may be an effective way of increasing accessibility while maintaining 
      treatment effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis
      that psychologist-guided ICBT improves school-aged children's and adolescents'
      ability to manage dental anxiety by (1) decreasing avoidance and affecting the
      phobia diagnosis and (2) decreasing the dental fear and increasing the target
      groups' self-efficacy. The study also aimed to examine the feasibility and
      acceptability of this novel treatment. METHODS: This was an open, uncontrolled
      trial with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and the 1-year follow-up. The 
      study enrolled and treated 18 participants. The primary outcome was level of
      avoidance behaviors, as measured by the picture-guided behavioral avoidance test 
      (PG-BAT). The secondary outcome was a diagnostic evaluation with the parents
      conducted by a psychologist. The specific phobia section of the structured
      interview Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
      School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL) was used. Other outcome
      measures included level of dental anxiety and self-efficacy. The ICBT, which
      employed exposure therapy, comprised 12 modules of texts, animations,
      dentistry-related video clips, and an exercise package (including dental
      instruments). Participants accessed the treatment through an Internet-based
      treatment platform and received Web-based guidance from a psychologist. Treatment
      also included training at dental clinics. Feasibility and acceptability were
      assessed by measures of engagement, adherence, compliance, completed measures,
      patient and parent satisfaction scale, and staff acceptability. RESULTS: The
      level of avoidance (according to the primary outcome measure PG-BAT) and dental
      anxiety decreased and self-efficacy increased significantly (P<.001),
      within-group effect sizes for both the primary outcome (Cohen d=1.5), and other
      outcomes were large in the range of 0.9 and 1.5. According to K-SADS-PL, 53%
      (8/15) of the participants were free from diagnosable dental anxiety at the
      1-year follow-up. At the 1-year follow-up, improvements were maintained and
      clinically significant, with 60% (9/15) of participants who had been unable to
      manage intraoral injection of local anesthetics before ICBT reporting having
      accomplished this task at a dental clinic. The target group showed improvement in
      all the outcome measures. High levels of feasibility and acceptability were
      observed for the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: ICBT is a promising and feasible
      treatment for dental anxiety in children and adolescents. Integrating it into
      routine pediatric dental care would increase access to an effective psychological
      treatment. The results of this open trial must be replicated in controlled
      studies.

      with group exposure sessions for adolescents with social anxiety disorder: a
      feasibility trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common psychiatric
      disorders in youth, with a prevalence of about 3%-4% and increased risk of
      adverse long-term outcomes, such as depression. Cognitive-behavioural therapy
      (CBT) is considered the first-line treatment for youth with SAD, but many
      adolescents remain untreated due to limited accessibility to CBT. The aim of this
      study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a
      therapist-guided internet-delivered CBT treatment, supplemented with clinic-based
      group exposure sessions (BIP SOFT). DESIGN: A proof-of-concept, open clinical
      trial with 6-month follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: The trial was conducted at a child
      and adolescent psychiatric research clinic, and participants (n=30) were 13-17
      years old (83% girls) with a principal diagnosis of SAD. INTERVENTION: 12 weeks
      of intervention, consisting of nine remote therapist-guided internet-delivered
      CBT sessions and three group exposure sessions at the clinic for the adolescents 
      and five internet-delivered sessions for the parents. RESULTS: Adolescents were
      generally satisfied with the treatment, and the completion rate of internet
      modules, as well as attendance at group sessions, was high. Post-treatment
      assessment showed a significant decrease in clinician-rated, adolescent-rated and
      parent-rated social anxiety (d=1.17, 0.85 and 0.79, respectively), as well as in 
      general self-rated and parent-rated anxiety and depression (d=0.76 and 0.51),
      compared with pretreatment levels. Furthermore, 47% of participants no longer met
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
      criteria for SAD at post-treatment. At a 6-month follow-up, symptom reductions
      were maintained, or further improved, and 57% of participants no longer met
      criteria for SAD. CONCLUSION: Therapist-guided and parent-guided
      internet-delivered CBT, supplemented with a limited number of group exposure
      sessions, is a feasible and promising intervention for adolescents with SAD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exposure tasks are recognized widely as a key component of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for child and adolescent anxiety. However,
      little research has examined specific exposure characteristics that predict
      outcomes for youth with anxiety and that may guide its application in therapy.
      METHOD: This study draws on a sample of 279 children and adolescents (48.4% male;
      79.6% white) with a principal anxiety disorder who received 14 sessions of CBT,
      either alone or in combination with medication, through the Child/adolescent
      Anxiety Multimodal treatment Study (CAMS). The present study examines
      therapist-reported quantity, difficulty level, compliance, and mastery of
      exposure tasks as they related to CBT response (i.e., Clinical Global
      Impressions-Improvement ratings). Secondary treatment outcomes included reduction
      in anxiety symptom severity on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, global
      impairment measured via the Children's Global Assessment Scale, and parent-report
      of anxiety-specific functional impairment on the Child Anxiety Impairment Scale. 
      RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated a dose-response relationship between
      therapist-reported quantity of exposure and independent evaluations of treatment 
      outcome, with more time devoted to exposure linked to better outcomes. Similarly,
      greater time spent on more difficult (rather than mild or moderate) exposure
      tasks predicted better outcomes, as did therapist ratings of child compliance and
      mastery. CONCLUSION: The present findings highlight the importance of challenging
      children and adolescents with difficult exposure tasks and of collaborating to
      ensure compliance and mastery.

PG  - 263-285
LID - 10.1080/16506073.2017.1388275 [doi]
AB  - This review aimed to identify the strategies used in programs based on cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) to prevent and treat symptoms of anxiety, depression,
      and internalized behaviors of children and adolescents. Based on an online search
      (ERIC, PsycInfo, Virtuose UQAM, and Google Scholar), 61 studies describing
      different cognitive behavioral programs were selected. Results showed that 40
      strategies were implemented in at least one program. However, none of the
      strategies were systematically present in all programs, and only few were
      reported in more than 50% of the studies. Cognitive restructuring and
      problem-solving were the most popular strategies to treat depressive symptoms,
      whereas anxiety programs also generally included relaxation and exposure.
      Furthermore, six strategies were identified in a single anxiety program, whereas 
      nine strategies were implemented in only one depression program. These results
      suggest that in anxiety and depression programs designed for children and
      adolescents, the label "CBT" encompasses a wide variety of programs with only few
      similar strategies. Such findings highlight the need to define a common basis for
      CBT programs, in order to better reflect CBT theory and to identify the
      effectiveness of the strategies included in these programs.

      with anorexia nervosa.
PG  - 433-439
LID - 10.7334/psicothema2016.372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa exhibits high comorbidity rates and shared features 
      with anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety-based
      etiological models have proposed that fear of eating-related stimuli is the
      central mechanism around which avoidance of food and food-related rituals are
      performed. Building on this approach, exposure-based interventions have
      demonstrated promising results. Limited evidence in adolescents encourages the
      evaluation of exposure approaches in this population. METHOD: The current study
      presents a preliminary evaluation, in eight adolescents with anorexia nervosa, of
      an exposure-based CBT featuring an intensive format and parental involvement.
      RESULTS: significant improvements in physical and psychological outcomes were
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: this case series provides preliminary support for the
      efficacy of intensive family exposure-based CBT for treating adolescents with
      severe anorexia nervosa.

PG  - 707-728
LID - 10.1177/0145445517730831 [doi]
AB  - Archival data were used to examine the feasibility of a 5-day, clinic-based,
      intensive exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy for childhood anxiety
      disorders (CADs) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Participants were 143
      children (82 girls) aged 6 to 19 years ( M = 13.93 years, SD = 2.9 years) with
      CADs or OCD (or both) in 28 consecutive groups. Repeated-measures ANOVA in the
      subsample ( n = 57) with complete treatment data indicated positive change on all
      variables from pretreatment to posttreatment with few differences between CADs
      and OCD patients. Effect sizes were moderate to large for anxiety symptoms
      (parent reported = 0.74, child reported = 0.65) and impairment (parent reported =
      1.02, child reported = 0.69). The intensive group protocol required fewer
      sessions and 36% fewer therapist-hours per patient than the individually
      administered protocol. The program increased treatment availability for families 
      from diverse geographic areas ( M distance traveled to clinic = 407 miles, SD =
      786.4 miles). These findings support further, well-controlled examination of the 
      5-day intensive group treatment protocol's efficacy and potential to increase
      availability of evidence-based exposure therapy.

BTI - Treatment of Anxiety Disorders: A Systematic Review
AB  - Background The assignment was to examine various methods of treating the
      established anxiety disorders. Intervention to alleviate non-specific symptoms of
      worry, apprehension and anxiety were not part of the assignment. The assessment
      included the treatment of children, adolescents and adults with:Panic disorder
      (PD). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Specific phobias. Because the course of
      anxiety disorders is often protracted, a special focus was placed on identifying 
      studies that evaluate the long-term effects of treatment. For each anxiety
      disorder, one or more treatments have proven to be effective (strong scientific
      evidence). With the exception of specific phobias, both pharmacological treatment
      and psychotherapy are moderately effective. The symptoms are alleviated, but full
      remission is rarely achieved. With a few exceptions, the symptoms recur once
      treatment has been completed. The socioeconomic costs - primarily in terms of
      lower productivity, as well as greater ill-health, death rates and the need for
      somatic care (treatment for physical symptoms) - are high. The cost effectiveness
      of various treatment options has not been determined. There is insufficient
      scientific evidence for comparing either the efficacy or cost effectiveness of
      different treatments. Studies of psychodynamic therapies are almost totally
      lacking. Some benzodiazepines have been shown to be effective in treating certain
      anxiety disorders. However, it has been well established that the drugs cause
      significant problems in terms of side effects, dependence or an exacerbation of
      symptoms after treatment has proceeded for a certain period of time. No study has
      unequivocally explained why anxiety disorders are associated with raised death
      rates. Long-term studies on how to reduce raised death rates through some form of
      intervention are lacking. Panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia (fear 
      of having a panic attack in a place from which escape would be difficult): The
      antidepressants sertraline, paroxetine, imipramine and clomipramine (strong
      scientific evidence), as well as most likely citalopram and moclobemide (limited 
      scientific evidence), reduce the frequency of panic attacks. Agoraphobia is only 
      slightly affected by antidepressants (moderately strong scientific evidence).
      Exposure to the situations that cause panic alleviates the symptoms of
      agoraphobia with PD (moderately strong scientific evidence). Cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) that includes exposure alleviates the symptoms of PD without
      agoraphobia or with mild to moderate agoraphobia (strong scientific evidence).
      Its effectiveness for PD with severe agoraphobia has not been established.
      Exposure as a monotherapy alleviates the symptoms of agoraphobia (moderately
      strong scientific evidence). Psychotherapy has a more long lasting effect than
      psychotropic drugs (moderately strong scientific evidence). Antidepressants and
      CBT or exposure have proven to be more effective in combination than as
      monotherapies (moderately strong scientific evidence). Specific Phobias:
      Exposure, modeling and participant modeling, in which the patient learns to
      handle whatever triggers the fear, has a substantial, long-term impact on
      specific phobias (strong scientific evidence). There is no proven pharmacological
      treatment for specific phobias. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD): Fluvoxamine,
      sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine and escitalopram alleviate the symptoms of
      SAD (strong scientific evidence). CBT, particularly in a group setting,
      alleviates the symptoms of SAD (strong scientific evidence). Antidepressants and 
      psychological therapies have not proven more effective in combination than when
      administered separately (moderately strong scientific evidence).
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): Clomipramine, sertraline, paroxetine,
      fluoxetine, fluvoxamine (strong scientific evidence) and citalopram (moderately
      strong scientific evidence) alleviate the symptoms of both obsessions and
      compulsions. The drugs are effective as long as they are being administered, but 
      most patients relapse once the treatment has been terminated (moderately strong
      scientific evidence). Behavioral therapy (exposure / response prevention) reduces
      the symptoms in approximately half of all patients with compulsions (strong
      scientific evidence). The effect remains at two-year follow-up (moderately strong
      scientific evidence). Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Fluoxetine,
      sertraline and paroxetine alleviate the symptoms of PTSD (strong scientific
      evidence). Sertraline remains effective at one-year follow up (strong scientific 
      evidence). Various kinds of repeated exposure to that which is reminiscent of the
      traumatic event (strong scientific evidence) and CBT (moderately strong
      scientific evidence) alleviate the symptoms of PTSD. Eye Movement Desensitization
      and Reprocessing (EMDR), which combines eye movements with behavioral therapy, is
      effective for PTSD (moderately strong scientific evidence), but the eye movements
      lack specific therapeutic value (strong scientific evidence). Generalized Anxiety
      Disorder (GAD): Paroxetine, venlafaxine (strong scientific evidence), sertraline 
      and escitalopram (moderately strong scientific evidence) alleviate the symptoms
      of GAD. CBT is effective for GAD (moderately strong scientific evidence).
      Treating Children and Adolescents: CBT alleviates the symptoms of separation
      anxiety disorder, overanxious disorder, GAD and SAD (strong scientific evidence).
      The effect remains at two-year follow-up (moderately strong scientific evidence).
      Fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and fluvoxamine have proven to alleviate the
      symptoms, but none of them has been approved for these disorders in children and 
      adolescents. Exposure to the feared object or situation is effective for patients
      with specific phobias (strong scientific evidence). Clomipramine, sertraline,
      fluoxetine (strong scientific evidence), paroxetine and fluvoxamine (moderately
      strong scientific evidence) alleviate the symptoms of OCD. Clomipramine,
      sertraline and fluvoxamine have been approved for treatment in children and
      adolescents. Behavioral therapy, whether CBT or not, is equally effective as
      antidepressants for treating OCD (strong scientific evidence). Combination
      treatment is somewhat more effective (strong scientific evidence). CBT alleviates
      the symptoms of PTSD (moderately strong scientific evidence).

AB  - Virtual reality is a relatively new technology that enables individuals to
      immerse themselves in a virtual world. It offers several advantages including a
      more realistic, lifelike environment that may allow subjects to "forget" they are
      being assessed, allow a better participation and an increased generalization of
      learning. Moreover, the virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli,
      such as visual and auditory stimuli, and can also be used to evaluate the
      patient's multimodal integration and to aid rehabilitation of cognitive
      abilities. The use of virtual reality to treat various psychiatric disorders in
      adults (phobic anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating
      disorders, addictions...) and its efficacy is supported by numerous studies.
      Similar research for children and adolescents is lagging behind. This may be
      particularly beneficial to children who often show great interest and
      considerable success on computer, console or videogame tasks. This article will
      expose the main studies that have used virtual reality with children and
      adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders. The use of virtual reality to
      treat anxiety disorders in adults is gaining popularity and its efficacy is
      supported by various studies. Most of the studies attest to the significant
      efficacy of the virtual reality exposure therapy (or in virtuo exposure). In
      children, studies have covered arachnophobia social anxiety and school refusal
      phobia. Despite the limited number of studies, results are very encouraging for
      treatment in anxiety disorders. Several studies have reported the clinical use of
      virtual reality technology for children and adolescents with autistic spectrum
      disorders (ASD). Extensive research has proven the efficiency of technologies as 
      support tools for therapy. Researches are found to be focused on communication
      and on learning and social imitation skills. Virtual reality is also well
      accepted by subjects with ASD. The virtual environment offers the opportunity to 
      administer controlled tasks such as the typical neuropsychological tools, but in 
      an environment much more like a standard classroom. The virtual reality classroom
      offers several advantages compared to classical tools such as more realistic and 
      lifelike environment but also records various measures in standardized
      conditions. Most of the studies using a virtual classroom have found that
      children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder make significantly fewer
      correct hits and more commission errors compared with controls. The virtual
      classroom has proven to be a good clinical tool for evaluation of attention in
      ADHD. For eating disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program enhanced 
      by a body image specific component using virtual reality techniques was shown to 
      be more efficient than cognitive behavioural therapy alone. The body
      image-specific component using virtual reality techniques boots efficiency and
      accelerates the CBT change process for eating disorders. Virtual reality is a
      relatively new technology and its application in child and adolescent psychiatry 
      is recent. However, this technique is still in its infancy and much work is
      needed including controlled trials before it can be introduced in routine
      clinical use. Virtual reality interventions should also investigate how newly
      acquired skills are transferred to the real world. At present virtual reality can
      be considered a useful tool in evaluation and treatment for child and adolescent 
      disorders.

TI  - Common mental disorders in asylum seekers and refugees: umbrella review of
      prevalence and intervention studies.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/s13033-017-0156-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been a progressive rise in the number of
      asylum seekers and refugees displaced from their country of origin, with
      significant social, economic, humanitarian and public health implications. In
      this population, up-to-date information on the rate and characteristics of mental
      health conditions, and on interventions that can be implemented once mental
      disorders have been identified, are needed. This umbrella review aims at
      systematically reviewing existing evidence on the prevalence of common mental
      disorders and on the efficacy of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions
      in adult and children asylum seekers and refugees resettled in low, middle and
      high income countries. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review of systematic
      reviews summarizing data on the prevalence of common mental disorders and on the 
      efficacy of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in asylum seekers
      and/or refugees. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with
      the AMSTAR checklist. RESULTS: Thirteen reviews reported data on the prevalence
      of common mental disorders while fourteen reviews reported data on the efficacy
      of psychological or pharmacological interventions. Although there was substantial
      variability in prevalence rates, we found that depression and anxiety were at
      least as frequent as post-traumatic stress disorder, accounting for up to 40% of 
      asylum seekers and refugees. In terms of psychosocial interventions, cognitive
      behavioral interventions, in particular narrative exposure therapy, were the most
      studied interventions with positive outcomes against inactive but not active
      comparators. CONCLUSIONS: Current epidemiological data needs to be expanded with 
      more rigorous studies focusing not only on post-traumatic stress disorder but
      also on depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions. In addition, new 
      studies are urgently needed to assess the efficacy of psychosocial interventions 
      when compared not only with no treatment but also each other. Despite current
      limitations, existing epidemiological and experimental data should be used to
      develop specific evidence-based guidelines, possibly by international independent
      organizations, such as the World Health Organization or the United Nations High
      Commission for Refugees. Guidelines should be applicable to different
      organizations of mental health care, including low and middle income countries as
      well as high income countries.

TI  - Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Children With Pain-Related
      Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: Feasibility Study.
PG  - e32
LID - 10.2196/mental.7985 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (P-FGIDs; eg,
      irritable bowel syndrome) are highly prevalent in children and associated with
      low quality of life, anxiety, and school absence. Treatment options are scarce,
      and there is a need for effective and accessible treatments. Internet-delivered
      cognitive behavior therapy (Internet-CBT) based on exposure exercises is
      effective for adult and adolescent irritable bowel syndrome, but it has not been 
      evaluated for younger children. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to
      assess acceptability, feasibility, and potential clinical efficacy of
      Internet-CBT for children with P-FGIDs. METHODS: This was a feasibility study
      with a within-group design. We included 31 children aged 8-12 years and diagnosed
      with P-FGID, according to the ROME III criteria. Mean duration of abdominal
      symptoms at baseline was 3.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 2.6). The treatment
      was therapist-guided and consisted of 10 weekly modules of exposure-based
      Internet-CBT. The children were instructed to provoke abdominal symptoms in a
      graded manner and to engage in previously avoided activities. The parents were
      taught to decrease their attention to their children's pain behaviors and to
      reinforce and support their work with the exposures. Assessments included
      treatment satisfaction, subjective treatment effect, gastrointestinal symptoms,
      quality of life, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, and school absence. Data
      were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Means,
      standard errors (SEs), and Cohen d effect sizes were estimated based on
      multi-level linear mixed models. RESULTS: Most children 25/31 (81%) completed 9
      or 10 of the 10 treatment modules. Almost all children, 28/31 (90%), reported
      that the treatment had helped them to deal more effectively with their symptoms, 
      and 27/31 (87%) children declared that their symptoms had improved during the
      treatment. Assessments from the parents were in accordance with the children's
      reports. No child or parent reported that the symptoms had worsened. We observed 
      a large within-group effect size on the primary outcome measure, child-rated
      gastrointestinal symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment (Cohen d=1.14,
      P<.001, 95% CI 0.69-1.61), and this effect size was maintained at 6-month
      follow-up (Cohen d=1.40, P<.001, 95% CI 1.04-1.81). We also observed significant 
      improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment on a wide range of child- and
      parent-rated measures including quality of life, pain intensity, anxiety,
      depression, and school absence. All results remained stable or were further
      improved at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that children with
      longstanding P-FGIDs, and their parents, perceive exposure-based Internet-CBT as 
      a helpful and feasible treatment. The included children improved significantly
      despite a long duration of abdominal symptoms before the intervention. The
      treatment shows potential to be highly effective for P-FGIDs. The results need to
      be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

TI  - Multimedia Field Test Thinking About Exposures? There's an App for That!
PG  - 121-127
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpra.2016.11.001 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety Coach is a smartphone application ("app") for iOS devices that is billed 
      as a self-help program for anxiety in youth and adults. The app is currently
      available in the iTunes store for a one-time fee of $4.99. Anxiety Coach is
      organized around three related content areas: (a) self-monitoring of anxiety
      symptoms, (b) learning about anxiety and its treatment, and (c) guiding users
      through the development of a fear hierarchy and completion of exposure tasks.
      Although the app includes psychoeducation about anxiety as well as information
      regarding specific skills individuals can use to cope with anxiety (e.g.,
      cognitive restructuring), the primary focus of the app is on exposure tasks. As
      such, the app includes a large library of potential exposure tasks that are
      relevant to treating common fears and worries, making Anxiety Coach useful to
      clients and clinicians alike. Additionally, Anxiety Coach prompts users to
      provide fear ratings while they are carrying out an exposure task and displays a 
      message instructing users to stop the exposure once fear ratings drop by half.
      These features work together to create an app that has the potential to greatly
      increase the reach of exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety.

TI  - I think I'm Going to be Sick: An Eight-Year-Old Boy with Emetophobia and
      Secondary Food Restriction.
PG  - 104-109
AB  - We present a case of an eight-year-old boy with a specific phobia of vomiting who
      developed subsequent food restriction and weight loss. Our case report includes a
      review of treatment modalities for specific phobias including cognitive
      behavioural and exposure therapy in young children and the importance of parental
      involvement in the treatment process. After an initial assessment and diagnosis
      of this boy with emetophobia, treatment took place over ten subsequent visits,
      one hour each in duration. His treatment included a cognitive approach utilizing 
      exposure therapy to re-introduce foods to his diet, working through a fear
      hierarchy, addressing cognitive distortions/misconceptions and psychoeducational 
      supports. Intermittent reinforcement was applied to help extinguish what we
      believe was an associatively learned fear of vomiting. Outcomes of the treatment 
      were measured by changes in behaviour and overall increase in food intake
      reported by the patient's parents. On completion of treatment, the family was no 
      longer concerned with the amount and variety of food he was eating, the patient
      reported less nausea, and he was more likely to eat in public. A post-treatment
      three-week telephone follow-up showed continued gains. Congruent with reported
      literature , this case confirms and highlights the efficacy of exposure therapy
      and age-appropriate cognitive treatment adaptations in treatment of emetophobia. 
      In addition, parental education and participation is recommended in treatment of 
      child cases.

AB  - Exposure therapy is recognized as the key component of cognitive-behavioral
      treatment for anxiety. However, exposure is the least used evidence-based
      treatment in community mental health settings and is the most challenging
      technique for clinicians to adopt within the context of effectiveness and
      implementation trials. Little work has examined clinician and organizational
      characteristics that predict use of exposure, which is important for identifying 
      implementation strategies that may increase its use. In a large sample of
      community health clinicians (N=335) across 31 clinical practice sites, this study
      characterized clinician and organizational predictors of exposure use and
      relaxation for anxiety. Mixed effects regression analyses indicated that both
      clinician attitudes and an organization's implementation climate may be important
      levers for interventions seeking to increase clinician exposure use. Greater
      clinician use of relaxation strategies was also associated with less exposure
      use. Results point to important implications for implementing
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety, including de-emphasizing relaxation and
      attending to organizational climate.

PG  - 432-437
LID - 10.1007/s10597-017-0108-9 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the prevalence of common barriers to the use of exposure 
      therapy (ET) in the treatment of youth with anxiety disorders, specifically
      examining both logistical limitations and negative beliefs about ET. Results from
      230 practicing clinicians who treat youth with anxiety disorders found that the
      top three barriers were session length (56%), lack of training (48%), and concern
      about parent reaction (47%). Endorsement of barriers to ET was associated with
      less ET utilization and less optimal implementation of ET. Results suggest that
      several barriers, especially logistical limitations, must be addressed in order
      to improve the dissemination of ET.

TI  - Development and Initial Psychometrics for a Therapist Competence Instrument for
      CBT for Youth Anxiety.
PG  - 47-60
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2016.1253018 [doi]
AB  - Therapist competence is an important component of treatment integrity. This
      article reports on the development and initial psychometric assessment of the
      Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Anxiety in Youth Competence Scale (CBAY-C), an
      observational instrument designed to capture therapist limited-domain competence 
      (i.e., competence in the delivery of core interventions and delivery methods
      found in a specific psychosocial treatment program) in the delivery of the core
      practice elements in individual cognitive-behavioral treatment (ICBT) for youth
      anxiety. Treatment sessions (N = 744) from 68 youth participants (M age = 10.60
      years, SD = 2.03; 82.3% Caucasian; 52.9% male) of the same ICBT program for youth
      anxiety from (a) an efficacy study and (b) an effectiveness study were
      independently scored by 4 coders using observational instruments designed to
      assess therapist competence, treatment adherence, treatment differentiation,
      alliance, and client involvement. Interrater reliability-intraclass correlation
      coefficients (2,2)-for the item scores averaged 0.69 (SD = 0.11). The CBAY-C
      item, scale, and subscale (Skills, Exposure) scores showed evidence of validity
      via associations with observational instruments of treatment adherence to ICBT
      for youth anxiety, theory-based domains (cognitive-behavioral treatment,
      psychodynamic, family, client centered), alliance, and client involvement.
      Important to note, although the CBAY-C scale, subscale, and item scores did
      overlap with a corresponding observational treatment adherence instrument
      independently rated by coders, the degree of overlap was moderate, indicating
      that the CBAY-C assesses a distinct component of treatment integrity.
      Applications of the instrument and future research directions discussed include
      the measurement of treatment integrity and testing integrity-outcome relations.

      Exposed to Traumatic Events.
PG  - 303-330
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2016.1220309 [doi]
AB  - Child and adolescent trauma exposure is prevalent, with trauma exposure-related
      symptoms, including posttraumatic stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms often 
      causing substantial impairment. This article updates the evidence base on
      psychosocial treatments for child and adolescent trauma exposure completed for
      this journal by Silverman et al. (2008). For this review, we focus on 37 studies 
      conducted during the seven years since the last review. Treatments are grouped by
      overall treatment family (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy), treatment modality
      (e.g., individual vs. group), and treatment participants (e.g., child only vs.
      child and parent). All studies were evaluated for methodological rigor according 
      to Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology evidence-based treatment
      evaluation criteria (Southam-Gerow & Prinstein, 2014), with cumulative
      designations for level of support for each treatment family. Individual CBT with 
      parent involvement, individual CBT, and group CBT were deemed well-established;
      group CBT with parent involvement and eye movement desensitization and
      reprocessing (EMDR) were deemed probably efficacious; individual integrated
      therapy for complex trauma and group mind-body skills were deemed possibly
      efficacious; individual client-centered play therapy, individual mind-body
      skills, and individual psychoanalysis were deemed experimental; and group
      creative expressive + CBT was deemed questionable efficacy. Advances in the
      evidence base, with comparisons to the state of the science at the time of the
      Silverman et al. (2008) review, are discussed. Finally, we present dissemination 
      and implementation challenges and areas for future research.

TI  - The Length of Child Anxiety Treatment in a Regional Health System.
PG  - 985-992
AB  - Anxiety disorders are often undertreated due to unsuccessful dissemination of
      evidence-based treatments (EBTs). Lack of empirical data regarding the typical
      length of treatment in clinical settings may hamper the development of clinically
      relevant protocols. The current study examined billing records for 335 children
      ages 7-17 years to quantify the treatment received for newly diagnosed anxiety
      disorders within a regional health system. The vast majority of patients did not 
      receive a sufficient number of appointments to complete the typical cognitive
      behavioral therapy protocol or reach the sessions introducing exposure. Although 
      half of the sample received pharmacotherapy, the vast majority received fewer
      follow-up appointments than participants in pharmacotherapy research studies.
      Further, the type of treatment (i.e., number of sessions and medication) differed
      depending on utilization of specialty care. These results underscore the need to 
      develop brief and flexible EBT protocols that can be standardized and implemented
      in community practice.

      Pilot Trial.
PG  - e0164647
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0164647 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (P-FGIDs) have an increased risk for school absenteeism, depression, anxiety and 
      low quality of life. Exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has shown
      large treatment effects in adults with irritable bowel syndrome, but has not been
      tested for children 8-12 years with P-FGIDs. AIM: The aim of this trial was to
      test the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of a newly developed
      exposure-based CBT for children with P-FGIDs. METHOD: The children (n = 20) with 
      a P-FGID, were referred by their treating physicians. The participants received
      10 weekly sessions of exposure-based CBT and were assessed at pre-treatment,
      post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Children improved significantly on
      the primary outcome measure pain intensity at post (Cohen's d = 0.40, p = 0.049) 
      and at 6-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.85, p = 0.004). Improvements were also
      seen in pain frequency, gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, depression,
      anxiety, school absenteeism and somatic symptoms. Improvements were maintained or
      further increased at 6-month follow-up. The children engaged in the exposures and
      were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure-based CBT for children
      with P-FGIDs is feasible, acceptable and potentially efficacious.

      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in an Adolescent With Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 1162-1173
LID - 10.1002/jclp.22396 [doi]
AB  - There is a high rate of comorbidity between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
      and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Standard cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)
      protocols have been shown to be less effective in treating OCD in young people
      with ASD than in typically developing youth. This case study describes the
      treatment of an adolescent boy with severe, treatment-resistant OCD and ASD using
      a modified CBT approach. Modifications to a standard evidence-based CBT for OCD
      protocol included extended psychoeducation about anxiety; regular home-based
      sessions; and increased involvement of systems, including family and school.
      Multi-informant outcome data indicated significant improvements in OCD symptoms
      over the course of treatment with gains being maintained over a 12-month
      follow-up period. These findings demonstrate the potential efficacy of modified
      CBT for pediatric OCD in the context of ASD.

TI  - Ethical Considerations in Exposure Therapy With Children.
PG  - 184-193
AB  - Despite the abundance of research that supports the efficacy of exposure therapy 
      for childhood anxiety disorders and OCD, negative views and myths about the
      harmfulness of this treatment are prevalent. These beliefs contribute to the
      underutilization of this treatment and less robust effectiveness in community
      settings compared to randomized clinical trials. Although research confirms that 
      exposure therapy is efficacious, safe, tolerable, and bears minimal risk when
      implemented correctly, there are unique ethical considerations in exposure
      therapy, especially with children. Developing ethical parameters around exposure 
      therapy for youth is an important and highly relevant area that may assist with
      the effective generalization of these principles. The current paper reviews
      ethical issues and considerations relevant to exposure therapy for children and
      provides suggestions for the ethical use of this treatment.

TI  - A randomized trial of cognitive behavior therapy and cognitive therapy for
      children with posttraumatic stress disorder following single-incident trauma:
      Predictors and outcome at 1-year follow-up.
PG  - 471-478
LID - 10.1037/tra0000190 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The 1-year outcome and moderators of adjustment for children and youth
      receiving treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following
      single-incident trauma was examined. METHOD: Children and youth who had
      experienced single-incident trauma (N = 33; 7-17 years old) were randomly
      assigned to receive 9 weeks of either trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy
      (CBT) or trauma-focused cognitive therapy (without exposure; CT) that was
      administered to them and their parents individually. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat
      analyses demonstrated that both groups maintained posttreatment gains in PTSD,
      depression and general anxiety symptoms reductions at 1-year follow-up, with no
      children meeting criteria for PTSD. A large proportion of children showed good
      end-state functioning at follow-up (CBT: 65%; CT: 71%). Contrary to 6-month
      outcomes, maternal adjustment no longer moderated children's outcome, nor did any
      other tested variables. CONCLUSION: The findings confirm the positive longer-term
      outcomes of using trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral methods for PTSD secondary 
      to single-incident trauma and that these outcomes are not dependent on the use of
      exposure. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - A hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized trial of group CBT for
      anxiety in urban schools: rationale, design, and methods.
PG  - 92
LID - 10.1186/s13012-016-0453-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schools present a context with great potential for the implementation
      of psychosocial evidence-based practices. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is
      an evidence-based practice that has been found to be very effective in treating
      anxiety in various community settings, including schools. Friends for Life
      (FRIENDS) is an efficacious group CBT protocol for anxiety. Unfortunately,
      evidence-based practices for anxiety are seldom employed in under-resourced urban
      schools, because many treatment protocols are not a good fit for the urban school
      context or the population, existing behavioral health staff do not receive
      adequate training or support to allow them to implement the treatment with
      fidelity, or school districts do not have the resources to contract with external
      consultants. In our prior work, we adapted FRIENDS to create a more culturally
      sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT protocol for anxiety disorders (CBT for
      Anxiety Treatment in Schools (CATS)). METHODS/DESIGN: The aim of this 5-year
      study is to evaluate both the effectiveness of CATS for urban public schools
      compared to the original FRIENDS as well as compare the implementation strategies
      (train-the-trainer vs. train-the-trainer + ongoing consultation) by conducting a 
      three-arm, parallel group, type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial in 18
      K-8 urban public schools. We will also assess the cost-effectiveness and the
      mediators and moderators of fidelity. Ninety therapists, 18 agency supervisors,
      and 360 children will participate. The interactive systems framework for
      dissemination and implementation guides the training and support procedures for
      therapists and supervisors. DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to
      demonstrate that agency therapists and supervisors who have had little to no
      prior exposure to evidence-based practices (EBPs) can implement an anxiety
      disorder EBP with fidelity. Comparisons of the implementation strategies would
      provide large urban mental health systems with data to make decisions about the
      adoption of EBPs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02651402.

AB  - Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), incorporating exposure and response prevention
      (ERP), has received strong empirical support for the treatment of paediatric OCD,
      and moreover, is considered the first line treatment of choice (Geller & March,
      2012). However, despite the availability of effective treatments for this chronic
      and debilitating disorder, only a small proportion of youth receive these
      evidence-based approaches. The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness
      of an intensive ERP-based treatment for youth OCD, using a multiple baseline
      controlled design. Children and youth (N=10; aged 11-16 years) with a primary
      diagnosis of OCD were randomly assigned to a 1- or 2-week baseline monitoring
      condition followed by the intervention. The efficacy of the intensive treatment, 
      involving 1 session psychoeducation, 2-sessions ERP plus e-therapy maintenance
      was examined across parent- child- and clinician-rated measures at post-treatment
      and 6-month follow-up. Overall, there were significant reductions across time on 
      almost all measures (except self-report anxiety), and moreover, the majority of
      the sample (80%) were considered reliably improved, and meeting clinically
      significant change. At post-treatment, 60% were in remission of symptoms, and at 
      6-month follow-up this increased to 70%. These findings provide strong support
      for intensive, time-limited approaches to ERP-based CBT for children and youth
      with OCD.

TI  - Online Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Treatment: Preliminary Results of the "OCD? 
      Not Me!" Self-Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for
      Young People.
PG  - e29
LID - 10.2196/mental.5363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development and evaluation of Internet-delivered cognitive
      behavioral therapy (iCBT) interventions provides a potential solution for current
      limitations in the acceptability, availability, and accessibility of mental
      health care for young people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
      Preliminary results support the effectiveness of therapist-assisted iCBT for
      young people with OCD; however, no previous studies have examined the
      effectiveness of completely self-guided iCBT for OCD in young people. OBJECTIVE: 
      We aimed to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of the OCD? Not
      Me! program for reducing OCD-related psychopathology in young people (12-18
      years). This program is an eight-stage, completely self-guided iCBT treatment for
      OCD, which is based on exposure and response prevention. METHODS: These data were
      early and preliminary results of a longer study in which an open trial design is 
      being used to evaluate the effectiveness of the OCD? Not Me! PROGRAM:
      Participants were required to have at least subclinical levels of OCD to be
      offered the online program. Participants with moderate-high suicide/self-harm
      risk or symptoms of eating disorder or psychosis were not offered the program.
      OCD symptoms and severity were measured at pre- and posttest, and at the
      beginning of each stage of the program. Data was analyzed using generalized
      linear mixed models. RESULTS: A total of 334 people were screened for inclusion
      in the study, with 132 participants aged 12 to 18 years providing data for the
      final analysis. Participants showed significant reductions in OCD symptoms
      (P<.001) and severity (P<.001) between pre- and posttest. CONCLUSIONS: These
      preliminary results suggest that fully automated iCBT holds promise as a way of
      increasing access to treatment for young people with OCD; however, further
      research needs to be conducted to replicate the results and to determine the
      feasibility of the program. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical

      Anxiety.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2016.1163707 [doi]
AB  - Exposure has been identified as key to effective treatment of youth anxiety.
      However, the precise theoretical mechanisms of exposure are a matter of debate.
      Emotional processing theory emphasizes the need for fear activation during
      exposure and its habituation both within and across exposures. Despite the
      popularity of the theory to explain exposure, it has not been tested with anxious
      youth. To determine whether emotional processing theory parameters predict
      anxiety severity, coping abilities, and global functioning after
      cognitive-behavioral treatment. The present study examined 72 youth (Mage = 10.50
      years; 45% female; 87.5% non-Hispanic Caucasian) diagnosed with an anxiety
      disorder and who received family or individual CBT. Three exposure habituation
      variables-initial fear activation (peak anxiety), within-session habituation, and
      between-session habituation-were assessed using Subjective Units of Distress and 
      examined as predictors of outcome at posttreatment and at 1-year follow-up.
      Outcomes were measured using the Coping Questionnaire, Multidimensional Anxiety
      Scale for Children, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Children's Global 
      Assessment Scale, and clinician severity ratings on the Anxiety Disorder
      Interview Schedule. Emotional processing theory variables did not predict any
      anxiety outcomes at posttreatment or follow-up with one exception: Initial fear
      activation predicted less anxiety at follow-up among youth without GAD. In
      addition, within- and between-session habituation were not associated with one
      another. Between-session habituation was not associated with initial fear
      activation. These findings suggest a limited role of habituation within
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety in youth. An alternative to emotional
      processing theory, inhibitory learning theory, is discussed.

TI  - Predicting Response Trajectories during Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Panic
      Disorder: No Association with the BDNF Gene or Childhood Maltreatment.
PG  - e0158224
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and result in low quality of
      life and a high social and economic cost. The efficacy of cognitive-behavioural
      therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders is well established, but a substantial
      proportion of patients do not respond to this treatment. Understanding which
      genetic and environmental factors are responsible for this differential response 
      to treatment is a key step towards "personalized medicine". Based on previous
      research, our objective was to test whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and/or
      childhood maltreatment are associated with response trajectories during
      exposure-based CBT for panic disorder (PD). METHOD: We used Growth Mixture
      Modeling to identify latent classes of change (response trajectories) in patients
      with PD (N = 97) who underwent group manualized exposure-based CBT. We conducted 
      logistic regression to investigate the effect on these trajectories of the BDNF
      Val66Met polymorphism and two different types of childhood maltreatment, abuse
      and neglect. RESULTS: We identified two response trajectories ("high response"
      and "low response"), and found that they were not significantly associated with
      either the genetic (BDNF Val66Met polymorphism) or childhood trauma-related
      variables of interest, nor with an interaction between these variables.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support an effect of the BDNF gene or
      childhood trauma-related variables on CBT outcome in PD. Future studies in this
      field may benefit from looking at other genotypes or using different (e.g.
      whole-genome) approaches.

TI  - A Critical Review of Negative Affect and the Application of CBT for PTSD.
PG  - 176-194
LID - 10.1177/1524838016650188 [doi]
AB  - Forms of cognitive and behavioral therapies (CBTs), including prolonged exposure 
      and cognitive processing therapy, have been empirically validated as efficacious 
      treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the assumption that
      PTSD develops from dysregulated fear circuitry possesses limitations that detract
      from the potential efficacy of CBT approaches. An analysis of these limitations
      may provide insight into improvements to the CBT approach to PTSD, beginning with
      an examination of negative affect as an essential component to the
      conceptualization of PTSD and a barrier to the implementation of CBT for PTSD. As
      such, the literature regarding the impact of negative affect on aspects of
      cognition (i.e., attention, processing, memory, and emotion regulation) necessary
      for the successful application of CBT was systematically reviewed. Several
      literature databases were explored (e.g., PsychINFO and PubMed), resulting in 25 
      articles that met criteria for inclusion. Results of the review indicated that
      high negative affect generally disrupts cognitive processes, resulting in a
      narrowed focus on stimuli of a negative valence, increased rumination of negative
      autobiographical memories, inflexible preservation of initial information,
      difficulty considering counterfactuals, reliance on emotional reasoning, and
      misinterpretation of neutral or ambiguous events as negative, among others. With 
      the aim to improve treatment efficacy of CBT for PTSD, suggestions to incorporate
      negative affect into research and clinical contexts are discussed.

TI  - Extinction learning in childhood anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder
      and post-traumatic stress disorder: implications for treatment.
PG  - 1155-74
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2016.1199276 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Threat conditioning and extinction play an important role in
      anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Although these conditions commonly affect children, threat
      conditioning and extinction have been primarily studied in adults. However,
      differences in phenomenology and neural architecture prohibit the generalization 
      of adult findings to youth. AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive literature search
      using PubMed and PsycInfo was conducted to identify studies that have used
      differential conditioning tasks to examine threat acquisition and extinction in
      youth. The information obtained from this review helps to clarify the influence
      of these processes on the etiology and treatment of youth with OCD, PTSD and
      other anxiety disorders. Thirty studies of threat conditioning and extinction
      were identified Expert commentary: Youth with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD
      have largely comparable threat acquisition relative to unaffected controls, with 
      some distinctions noted for youth with PTSD or youth who have suffered
      maltreatment. However, impaired extinction was consistently observed across youth
      with these disorders and appears to be consistent with deficiencies in inhibitory
      learning. Incorporating strategies to improve inhibitory learning may improve
      extinction learning within extinction-based treatments like cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT). Strategies to improve inhibitory learning in CBT are discussed.

AB  - The current study examines factors related to use of exposure therapy by
      clinicians who treat children with anxiety disorders. A sample of 331 therapists 
      from a variety of backgrounds (i.e., social workers, doctoral psychologists,
      masters level counselors, and marriage and family therapists) completed a survey 
      regarding use of exposure and other treatment techniques for childhood anxiety
      disorders, as well as beliefs about exposure and child resiliency. Although the
      majority of therapists endorsed a CBT orientation (81%) and use of CBT
      techniques, exposure therapy was rarely endorsed. Holding a PhD in psychology as 
      well as more positive beliefs about exposure and child resiliency were associated
      with greater use of exposure. The results suggest that exposure-based therapy is 
      rarely offered in community settings and that dissemination should focus on
      individual evidence-based principles and correcting therapist misconceptions.

TI  - Treatment of nulliparous women with severe fear of childbirth via the Internet: a
      feasibility study.
PG  - 37-43
LID - 10.3109/0167482X.2016.1140143 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of Internet
      interventions among nulliparous women suffering from severe fear of childbirth
      (FOC) by means of an Internet-delivered therapist-supported self-help program
      based on cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal
      cohort study. SETTING: A feasibility study of an ICBT program for the treatment
      of severe FOC in pregnant women. SAMPLE: Twenty-eight Swedish-speaking
      nulliparous women with severe FOC recruited via a project home page from January 
      2012 to December 2013. METHODS: The main components of the ICBT program for the
      treatment of severe FOC comprised psycho-education, breathing retraining,
      cognitive restructuring, imaginary exposure, in vivo exposure and relapse
      prevention. The study participants were anonymously self-recruited over the
      Internet, interviewed by telephone and then enrolled. All participants were
      offered 8 weeks of treatment via the Internet. Participants reported their
      homework weekly, submitted measurements of their fear and received feedback from 
      a therapist via a secure online contact management system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Level of FOC measured with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire
      (W-DEQ A) during screening at enrollment and weekly during the treatment (W-DEQ
      version A), and after the delivery (W-DEQ version B). RESULTS: A statistically
      significant (p < 0.0005) decrease of FOC [W-DEQ sum score decreased pre to
      post-therapy, with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.95)]. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of this feasibility study suggest that ICBT has potential in the
      treatment of severe FOC during pregnancy in motivated nulliparous women. The
      results need to be confirmed by randomized controlled studies.

TI  - Evaluating differences in Pavlovian fear acquisition and extinction as predictors
      of outcome from cognitive behavioural therapy for anxious children.
PG  - 869-76
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12522 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extinction is a key theoretical model of exposure-based treatments,
      such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This study examined whether
      individual differences in physiological responses and subjective stimulus
      evaluations as indices of fear extinction predicted response to CBT. METHODS:
      Thirty-two nonanxious comparisons and 44 anxious, 7-to-13-year-old children
      completed a Pavlovian conditioning and extinction task. Anxious children then
      completed group-based CBT. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) as well as
      subjective arousal and valence evaluations were measured in response to a
      conditioned stimulus paired with an aversive tone (CS+) and another conditioned
      stimulus presented alone (CS-). Both stimuli were presented alone during
      extinction. Diagnostic and symptom measures were completed before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: Like nonanxious comparisons, treatment responders did not
      acquire conditioned negative stimulus evaluations and displayed elevated SCRs
      that declined significantly across extinction trials. Nonresponders, by contrast,
      showed elevated negative stimulus evaluations of both CSs that were sensitive to 
      extinction trials but showed no change in SCRs during extinction. Change in
      physiological but not evaluative indices of fear extinction predicted better
      treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Individual differences in evaluative and
      physiological indices of fear extinction might moderate response to CBT.

TI  - FEAR CONDITIONING AND EXTINCTION IN YOUTH WITH OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER.
PG  - 229-37
LID - 10.1002/da.22468 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear acquisition and extinction are central constructs in the
      cognitive-behavioral model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which
      underlies exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Youth with OCD may
      have impairments in fear acquisition and extinction that carry treatment
      implications. We examined these processes using a differential conditioning
      procedure. METHODS: Forty-one youth (19 OCD, 22 community comparisons) completed 
      a battery of clinical interviews, rating scales, and a differential conditioning 
      task that included habituation, acquisition, and extinction phases. Skin
      conductance response (SCR) served as the primary dependent measure. RESULTS:
      During habituation, no difference between groups was observed. During
      acquisition, differential fear conditioning was observed across participants as
      evidenced by larger SCRs to the CS+ compared to CS-; there were no between-group 
      differences. Across participants, the number and frequency of OCD symptoms and
      anxiety severity was associated with greater reactivity to stimuli during
      acquisition. During extinction, a three-way interaction and follow-up tests
      revealed that youth with OCD showed a different pattern of SCR extinction
      compared to the community comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with OCD exhibit a
      different pattern of fear extinction relative to community comparisons. This may 
      be attributed to impaired inhibitory learning and contingency awareness in
      extinction. Findings suggest the potential benefit of utilizing
      inhibitory-learning principles in CBT for youth with OCD, and/or augmentative
      retraining interventions prior to CBT to reduce threat bias and improve
      contingency detection.

      adolescents, yet few interventions are designed to treat both disorder classes
      together. Initial efficacy is presented of a school-based transdiagnostic group
      behavioral activation therapy (GBAT) that emphasizes anti-avoidance in vivo
      exposure. Youth (N = 35; ages 12-14; 50.9% male) were randomly assigned to either
      GBAT (n = 21) or WL (n = 14) after completing a double-gated screening process.
      Multi-reporter, multi-domain outcomes were assessed at pretreatment,
      posttreatment, and four-month follow-up (FU). GBAT was associated with greater
      posttreatment remission rates than WL in principal diagnosis (57.1% vs. 28.6%;
      X1(2) = 2.76, p = .09) and secondary diagnosis (70.6% vs. 10%; X1(2) = 9.26, p = 
      .003), and greater improvement in Clinical Global Impairment - Severity ratings, 
      B = -1.10 (0.42), p = .01. Symptom outcomes were not significantly different at
      posttreatment. GBAT produced greater posttreatment behavioral activation (large
      effect size) and fewer negative thoughts (medium effect), two transdiagnostic
      processes, both at the trend level. Most outcomes showed linear improvement from 
      pretreatment to FU that did not differ depending on initial condition assignment.
      Sample size was small, but GBAT is a promising transdiagnostic intervention for
      youth anxiety and unipolar mood disorders that can feasibly and acceptably be
      applied in school settings.

TI  - Common Questions About Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Psychiatric Disorders.
PG  - 807-12
AB  - Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a time-limited, goal-oriented psychotherapy
      that has been extensively researched and has benefits in a number of psychiatric 
      disorders, including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder,
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive-compulsive and tic
      disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and insomnia. CBT uses
      targeted strategies to help patients adopt more adaptive patterns of thinking and
      behaving, which leads to positive changes in emotions and decreased functional
      impairments. Strategies include identifying and challenging problematic thoughts 
      and beliefs, scheduling pleasant activities to increase environmental
      reinforcement, and extended exposure to unpleasant thoughts, situations, or
      physiologic sensations to decrease avoidance and arousal associated with
      anxiety-eliciting stimuli. CBT can be helpful in the treatment of posttraumatic
      stress disorder by emphasizing safety, trust, control, esteem, and intimacy.
      Prolonged exposure therapy is a CBT technique that includes a variety of
      strategies, such as repeated recounting of the trauma and exposure to feared
      real-world situations. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, CBT focuses 
      on establishing structures and routines, and clear rules and expectations within 
      the home and classroom. Early intensive behavioral interventions should be
      initiated in children with autism before three years of age; therapy consists of 
      12 to 40 hours of intensive treatment per week, for at least one year. In many
      disorders, CBT can be used alone or in combination with medications. However, CBT
      requires a significant commitment from patients. Family physicians are well
      suited to provide collaborative care for patients with psychiatric disorders, in 
      concert with cognitive behavior therapists.

AB  - Inhibition of fear generalization with new learning is an important process in
      treatments for anxiety disorders. Generalization of maladaptive cognitions
      related to traumatic experiences (overgeneralized beliefs) have been demonstrated
      to be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adult populations, 
      whereas more balanced, accommodated beliefs are associated with symptom
      improvement. It is not yet clear whether (a) overgeneralization and accommodation
      are associated with PTSD treatment outcome in youth, or (b whether accommodated
      beliefs can interact with or inhibit cognitive overgeneralization, as has been
      demonstrated in research on behavior-based fear generalization. The current study
      examined the relationships between overgeneralized and accommodated beliefs,
      child age, and symptom reduction in a sample of 81 youth (age 7-17 years), who
      received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Overgeneralized and
      accommodated beliefs expressed during the exposure phase of treatment were coded 
      in audio-recorded therapy sessions. Overgeneralization predicted (a) higher
      internalizing symptom scores at posttreatment, particularly for younger children,
      and less improvement over treatment, and (b) higher externalizing scores at
      1-year follow-up and steeper symptom increases over this period. In contrast,
      accommodation was associated with (a) lower posttreatment internalizing symptoms 
      and greater improvement over treatment, and (b) lower externalizing scores at
      1-year follow-up, particularly for younger children. High levels of accommodation
      moderated the relationship between overgeneralization and worse symptom outcomes,
      except when predicting the slope of internalizing scores over treatment, and age 
      did not moderate these effects. There were no significant predictors of
      child-reported PTSD-specific symptoms, although PTSD symptoms did decrease
      significantly over the course of treatment and maintain 1year after treatment.

TI  - Sustained Implementation of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Youth Anxiety and
      Depression: Long-term Effects of Structured Training and Consultation on
      Therapist Practice in the Field.
PG  - 70-79
AB  - Identifying factors that promote sustained implementation of evidence-based
      treatments (EBTs) after therapists receive training is critical for professional 
      psychology. To address the field's minimal knowledge in this area, we interviewed
      community-based therapists (N = 23) who had completed intensive training in
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for either anxiety or depression as part of a 
      randomized effectiveness trial (Southam-Gerow et al., 2010; Weisz et al., 2009). 
      Therapists were interviewed three to five years after completion of the initial
      trial, representing one of the longest-term follow-ups of therapist practices
      after training. Therapists viewed each protocol and their individual CBT
      strategies as effective and appropriate for the majority of their current anxiety
      and depression caseloads. However, therapists used parts of each protocol much
      more frequently than the protocol as a whole (i.e., 78.5% used parts of the
      Coping Cat, and 7.5% used the whole protocol; 58.6% used parts of the PASCET, and
      20% used the whole protocol). Therapists reported using problem-solving the most 
      and exposure exercises the least for current anxious cases; they used cognitive
      restructuring the most and homework the least for current depression cases.
      Interventions that were more difficult to implement in usual care settings were
      less likely to be sustained. Future efforts should evaluate the characteristics
      and structure of EBTs that are most acceptable to therapists and should
      investigate which kinds of ongoing learning supports will maintain therapist
      skills in and continued use of EBTs.

AB  - Individuals who are high in anxiety sensitivity (AS) are motivated to avoid
      sensations of anxiety. Consequently, AS is hypothesized to contribute to overall 
      avoidance of any feared stimuli. No studies have yet examined whether fear of a
      stimulus is a stronger predictor of behavioral avoidance in individuals who are
      high in AS compared to individuals who are low in AS. We examined whether AS
      moderates the association between fear of spiders and behavioral avoidance of
      spider stimuli in 50 clinically anxious youth. Fear of spiders significantly
      predicted avoidance of spider stimuli in youth high in AS but not in youth low in
      AS. These results provide support for the role of AS in avoidant behavior and
      help to explain the link between AS and the anxiety disorders. The results have
      implications for exposure-based anxiety treatments and highlight the importance
      of increasing anxious patients' ability to tolerate sensations of anxiety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined outcomes from a residential treatment program emphasizing 
      exposure and response prevention (ERP) to determine if the typically robust
      response to this treatment in outpatient settings extends to patients treated in 
      this unique context. METHOD: One hundred and seventy-two adolescents with primary
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) completed measures at admission and
      discharge. Almost all (92.4%) participants had at least two diagnoses and nearly 
      half (44.2%) had three or more. Treatment consisted of intensive ERP (i.e.,
      approximately 26.5 hr per week), additional cognitive behavioral therapy
      interventions, and medication management within a residential setting. In
      contrast to the samples reported on in the vast majority of other pediatric OCD
      trials, participants in the current study were living apart from their families
      and were immersed within the treatment setting, with staff members available at
      all times. RESULTS: Paired sample t-tests revealed significant decreases in OCD
      and depression severity. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that residential treatment 
      for adolescents with OCD using a multimodal approach emphasizing ERP can be
      effective for complex cases with significant comorbidity. Results were comparable
      with several randomized controlled trials.

AB  - This preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the feasibility of
      dismantling cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety disorders.
      Fourteen children (10 girls) ages 7 to 14 (m = 10.2) with social phobia,
      generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or panic disorder were
      randomized to receive 6 sessions of either a) the pre-exposure anxiety management
      strategies presented in traditional CBT, or b) parent-coached exposure therapy.
      The sample was selected from a treatment seeking population and is representative
      of children in clinical settings. Examination of fidelity ratings, dropouts, and 
      satisfaction ratings indicated that the interventions were distinguishable, safe,
      and tolerable. The overall sample improved significantly with pre-post effect
      sizes generally in the large range for both conditions. Between-group effect
      sizes indicating greater improvement with parent-coached exposure therapy were
      moderate or large for ten of 12 variables (i.e., 0.53 to 1.52). Re-evaluation
      after three months of open treatment suggested that the intervention emphasizing 
      exposure early maintained its superiority while requiring fewer appointments.

TI  - Mobile Device-Based Applications for Childhood Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 246-51
LID - 10.1089/cap.2015.0010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given that childhood anxiety disorders are common and frequently
      undertreated, novel treatment platforms are needed. The current article explores 
      the potential for mobile device-based (m-health) applications, to expand access
      to evidence-based treatment. METHODS: This article reviews the relevant
      literature regarding barriers to disseminating evidence-based treatment, the
      potential benefits of the m-health platform, standards for evaluating m-health
      interventions, and currently available applications. RESULTS: Although a large
      number of m-health applications for anxiety are available, the vast majority of
      them are inconsistent with therapy protocols supported by the child anxiety
      treatment literature. The relatively few m-health applications based on
      evidence-based practice have not yet been examined empirically. CONCLUSIONS:
      Realizing the potential of m-health for child anxiety will require addressing the
      uncertainty around the necessary and sufficient components of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as the common challenges associated
      with delivering interventions via information and communication technology. Mayo 
      Clinic Anxiety Coach is an m-health application designed by the author and
      colleagues to be consistent with exposure-based CBT and principles for effective 
      intervention delivery via information and communication technology.
      Recommendations for identifying, using, and developing m-health applications for 
      childhood anxiety disorders are presented.

TI  - Children and parents' experiences of cognitive behavioral therapy for dental
      anxiety--a qualitative study.
PG  - 317-26
LID - 10.1111/ipd.12181 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of dental anxiety in children and
      adolescents. Cognitive behavioral therapy is emerging as a treatment option. AIM:
      The purpose of this study is to explore how children with dental anxiety and
      their parents experience cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in dentistry. DESIGN:
      We interviewed 12 children and one of their parents and conducted a thematic
      analysis of the transcribed interviews. RESULTS: Perspective shift emerged as
      overarching theme in our thematic analysis. This theme consisted of three main
      themes, which were mastery, safety, and reduced fear. Six subthemes were also
      identified according to our analyses. Mastery includes two subthemes, gradual
      exposure and autonomy and control. Subthemes and sources for safety feeling were 
      therapeutic alliance and changed appraisal. The theme reduced fear also consisted
      of two subthemes; reduced anticipatory anxiety and coping. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results show that parents and children had positive experiences of CBT and its
      outcome and were able to benefit from this psychological treatment when dealing
      with dental anxiety.

TI  - CBT for Adolescents With Anxiety: Mature Yet Still Developing.
PG  - 519-30
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14081061 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders are common in adolescents (ages 12 to 18) and contribute to a
      range of impairments. There has been speculation that adolescents with anxiety
      are at risk for being treatment nonresponders. In this review, the authors
      examine the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescents with
      anxiety. Outcomes from mixed child and adolescent samples and from
      adolescent-only samples indicate that approximately two-thirds of youths respond 
      favorably to CBT. CBT produces moderate to large effects and shows superiority
      over control/comparison conditions. The literature does not support differential 
      outcomes by age: adolescents do not consistently manifest poorer outcomes
      relative to children. Although extinction paradigms find prolonged fear
      extinction in adolescent samples, basic research does not fully align with the
      processes and goals of real-life exposure. Furthermore, CBT is flexible and
      allows for tailored application in adolescents, and it may be delivered in
      alternative formats (i.e., brief, computer/Internet, school-based, and
      transdiagnostic CBT).

TI  - Components of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Related to Outcome in Childhood
      Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 240-51
LID - 10.1007/s10567-015-0184-8 [doi]
AB  - The present article uses meta-analysis to examine treatment components related to
      outcome within 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for childhood anxiety
      disorders (CADs) and eight RCTs for childhood obsessive compulsive disorder
      (OCD). Examination of the RCTs of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for CADs
      suggested that adding relaxation and delaying exposures until after the
      introduction of other anxiety management strategies does not increase the
      efficacy of exposure-based treatment. In addition, compared to the large effect
      size (ES) associated with exposure and response prevention (ERP) for OCD (k = 9, 
      mean ES = 1.93), the effect size associated with CBT for CADs (k = 44, mean ES = 
      0.89) did not differentiate from attention placebo (k = 11, mean ES = 0.55),
      although it was more effective than waitlist control (k = 24, mean ES = 0.22).
      Instructively, ERP for OCD involved more exposure initiated earlier and less
      relaxation than CBT for CADs. In addition, RCTs of ERP were more likely to use
      clinician-administered measures as opposed to self-report and to be conducted in 
      clinical versus recruited samples. These results suggest that dismantling studies
      using a gold-standard clinician-rated outcome measure to compare the value of
      adding anxiety management strategies to exposure will be necessary to increase
      the efficacy of CBT for CADs to levels achieved by ERP for OCD.

TI  - Augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies (CBT) with d-cycloserine for 
      anxiety and related disorders.
PG  - CD007803
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007803.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related 
      disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder
      (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh)
      and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line 
      treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of
      d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment 
      response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to
      investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by
      synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the
      guidelines recommended by Cochrane. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of DCS
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety
      and related disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of
      DCS across different anxiety and related disorders. SEARCH METHODS: This review
      fully incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression,
      Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This
      register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane
      Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO
      (1967 to date), the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and
      ClinicalTrials.gov . Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of
      RCTs were also checked. No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or
      publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive
      and behavioural therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and
      behavioural therapies for anxiety and related disorders were included. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for 
      eligibility and inclusion, extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered
      these into a customised extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain
      missing data. In addition, data entry and analysis were performed by two review
      authors (KSW and HB). MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788
      participants in outpatient settings, were included in the review. Sixteen studies
      had an age range of 18 to 75 years, while four investigated paediatric
      populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included children, adolescents and adults.
      The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N =
      5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from the studies was rated as
      having either low risk or unclear risk of bias.There was no evidence of a
      difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and
      placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for the treatment of 
      anxiety and related disorders in adults at the endpoint (treatment responders, N 
      = 9, risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.34; number of
      participants (n) = 449; low quality evidence) and between 1 and 12 months
      follow-up (N = 7, RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31; n = 383). DCS augmentation of
      cognitive and behavioural therapies was not superior to placebo augmentation of
      cognitive and behavioural therapies for children and adolescents, both at the
      endpoint (N = 4, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; n = 121; low quality evidence) and
      between 3 and 12 months follow-up (N = 3, RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; n =
      91).There was no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability for DCS
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared with placebo
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in adults (N = 16, RR 0.88;
      95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; n = 740), nor in children and adolescents (N = 4, RR 0.90;
      95% CI 0.17 to 4.69; n = 131). These conclusions were based on moderate quality
      evidence for adults, and very low quality evidence for children and adolescents. 
      Although the observed difference was small, it is noteworthy that there was a
      high efficacy of exposure-based therapies alone in the included trials. Due to
      the limited number of studies, subgroup analysis of moderating factors for
      clinical and methodological effect could not take place. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
      This review found no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of
      cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and
      behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and related disorders in children,
      adolescents and adults. These findings are based on low quality evidence from
      heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and incomplete data for clinical
      response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions on the use of DCS
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. Given there is
      some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further research is
      necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and
      behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude of
      effect in anxiety and related disorders.

      fear of turning into another person/object or acquiring unwanted characteristics.
      Relative to other OCD symptoms, little is known about the clinical presentation
      of transformation obsessions. The study aims to examine the clinical correlates
      and treatment prognosis of transformation obsessions in a paediatric OCD sample. 
      METHODS: The sample consisted of 346 youths with a primary diagnosis of OCD.
      Patients with and without transformation obsessions were compared in terms of
      demographic and clinical characteristics, and CBT outcomes. RESULTS: 10% of the
      sample endorsed transformation obsessions. Patients with transformation
      obsessions were more likely to be boys, to be on augmented medication regimes,
      and to present with more severe obsessions at assessment. A factor analysis
      identified four major OCD symptom clusters, with transformation obsessions
      loading on a 'forbidden thoughts' factor alongside aggressive, sexual, and
      religious obsessions. No group differences in treatment outcomes were observed.
      LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the cross-sectional and retrospective nature of 
      the study, the representativeness of our sample, and use of concomitant
      medication, among others. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first empirical
      evidence regarding phenomenological similarities and differences between
      paediatric OCD patients presenting with and without transformation obsessions.
      The findings suggest that transformation obsessions are best conceptualised as
      related to 'forbidden' obsessions and respond to exposure-based CBT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of treatment response in a large sample of
      pediatric participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The Nordic
      Long-term Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) Treatment Study (NordLOTS) included
      269 children and adolescents, 7 to 17 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      OCD. Outcomes were evaluated after 14 weekly sessions of exposure-based
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). METHOD: The association of 20 potential
      predictors, identified by literature review, along with their outcomes, was
      evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS)
      posttreatment. A CY-BOCS total score of </=15 was the primary outcome measure.
      RESULTS: The univariate analyses showed that children and adolescents who were
      older had more severe OCD, greater functional impairment, higher rates of
      internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and higher levels of anxiety and
      depression symptoms before treatment had significantly poorer outcomes after 14
      weeks of treatment. However, only age was a significant predictor in the
      multivariate model. CONCLUSION: In the multivariate analysis, only age predicted 
      better treatment outcome. Using univariate analysis, a variety of predictors of
      poorer treatment outcome after CBT was identified. The high impact of comorbid
      symptoms on outcome in pediatric OCD suggests that treatment should address
      comorbidity issues. The lack of a family predictor may be related to high family 
      involvement in this study. Future research strategies should focus on optimizing 
      intervention in the presence of these characteristics to achieve greater benefits
      for patients with OCD. Clinical trial registration information-Nordic Long-term

AB  - Anxious children show attention biases towards and away from threat stimuli.
      Moreover, threat avoidance compared to vigilance predicts a poorer outcome from
      exposure-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), yet the
      mechanisms underlying this differential response are unclear. Pavlovian fear
      conditioning is a widely accepted theory to explain the acquisition and
      extinction of fear, including exposure-based treatments, such as CBT. In typical 
      fear conditioning experiments, anxious children have shown larger physiological
      responses to an aversive unconditional stimulus (i.e., US on CS+ trials) and to
      non-reinforced stimuli (CS-) during fear acquisition and to both CSs during fear 
      extinction compared to non-anxious peers. This study examined whether threat
      avoidance compared to threat vigilance was related to differences in fear
      acquisition and extinction in anxious children. Thirty-four clinically-anxious
      children completed a visual probe task including angry-neutral face pairs to
      determine the direction of threat attention bias as well as a discriminant
      conditioning and extinction task in which a geometric shape CS+ was paired with
      an aversive tone US, while the CS- geometric shape was always presented alone
      during acquisition trials. Both CSs were presented alone during extinction
      trials. Fear acquisition and extinction were indexed by skin conductance
      responses (SCR) and subjective measures. Children were classified as threat
      vigilant (N = 18) and threat avoidant (n = 16) based on the direction of threat
      attention bias on the visual probe task. During acquisition, threat avoidant
      relative to threat vigilant anxious children displayed larger orienting SCRs to
      both CSs during the first block of trials and larger third interval SCRs to the
      US on CS+ trials as well as on CS- trials. During extinction, threat avoidant
      anxious children showed delayed extinction of SCRs to both the CS+ and CS- and
      reported higher subjective anxiety ratings after extinction compared to threat
      vigilant anxious children. Threat avoidant anxious children may be more reactive 
      physiologically to novel cues and to stimuli that become associated with threat
      and this may interfere with extinction learning. These findings could help
      explain previous evidence that threat avoidant anxious children do not respond as
      well as threat vigilant anxious children to exposure-based CBT.

AB  - Severe health anxiety can be effectively treated with exposure-based
      Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT), but information about which
      factors that predict outcome is scarce. Using data from a recently conducted RCT 
      comparing ICBT (n = 79) with Internet-delivered behavioral stress management
      (IBSM) (n = 79) the presented study investigated predictors of treatment outcome.
      Analyses were conducted using a two-step linear regression approach and the
      dependent variable was operationalized both as end state health anxiety at
      post-treatment and as baseline-to post-treatment improvement. A hypothesis driven
      approach was used where predictors expected to influence outcome were based on a 
      previous predictor study by our research group. As hypothesized, the results
      showed that baseline health anxiety and treatment adherence predicted both end
      state health anxiety and improvement. In addition, anxiety sensitivity, treatment
      credibility, and working alliance were significant predictors of health anxiety
      improvement. Demographic variables, i.e. age, gender, marital status, computer
      skills, educational level, and having children, had no significant predictive
      value. We conclude that it is possible to predict a substantial proportion of the
      outcome variance in ICBT and IBSM for severe health anxiety. The findings of the 
      present study can be of high clinical value as they provide information about
      factors of importance for outcome in the treatment of severe health anxiety.

AB  - Clinically elevated anxiety is a common, impairing feature of autism spectrum
      disorders (ASD). A modular CBT program designed for preteens with ASD, Behavioral
      Interventions for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA; Wood et al., 2009) was 
      enhanced and modified to address the developmental needs of early adolescents
      with ASD and clinical anxiety. Thirty-three adolescents (11-15 years old) were
      randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or an equivalent waitlist period. The CBT
      model emphasized exposure, challenging irrational beliefs, and behavioral
      supports provided by caregivers, as well as numerous ASD-specific treatment
      elements. Independent evaluators, parents, and adolescents rated symptom severity
      at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist. In intent-to-treat analyses, the CBT 
      group outperformed the waitlist group on independent evaluators' ratings of
      anxiety severity on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) and 79% of the CBT 
      group met Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale criteria for positive
      treatment response at posttreatment, as compared to only 28.6% of the waitlist
      group. Group differences were not found for diagnostic remission or questionnaire
      measures of anxiety. However, parent-report data indicated that there was a
      positive treatment effect of CBT on autism symptom severity. The CBT manual under
      investigation, enhanced for early adolescents with ASD, yielded meaningful
      treatment effects on the primary outcome measure (PARS), although additional
      developmental modifications to the manual are likely warranted. Future studies
      examining this protocol relative to an active control are needed.

TI  - Trajectories of change in youth anxiety during cognitive-behavior therapy.
PG  - 239-52

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the trajectory of youth anxiety following the
      introduction of specific cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) components: relaxation 
      training, cognitive restructuring, and exposure tasks. METHOD: Four hundred
      eighty-eight youths ages 7-17 years (50% female; 74% </= 12 years) were randomly 
      assigned to receive either CBT, sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or
      pill placebo (PBO) as part of their participation in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety
      Multimodal Study (CAMS). Youths in the CBT conditions were evaluated weekly by
      therapists using the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S; Guy, 1976)
      and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983) and every
      4 weeks by blind independent evaluators (IEs) using the Pediatric Anxiety Ratings
      Scale (PARS; RUPP Anxiety Study Group, 2002). Youths in SRT and PBO were included
      as controls. RESULTS: Longitudinal discontinuity analyses indicated that the
      introduction of both cognitive restructuring (e.g., changing self-talk) and
      exposure tasks significantly accelerated the rate of progress on measures of
      symptom severity and global functioning moving forward in treatment; the
      introduction of relaxation training had limited impact. Counter to expectations, 
      no strategy altered the rate of progress in the specific domain of anxiety that
      it was intended to target (i.e., somatic symptoms, anxious self-talk, avoidance
      behavior). CONCLUSIONS: Findings support CBT theory and suggest that cognitive
      restructuring and exposure tasks each make substantial contributions to
      improvement in youth anxiety. Implications for future research are discussed.

TI  - Psychological, social and welfare interventions for psychological health and
      well-being of torture survivors.
PG  - CD009317
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009317.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torture is widespread, with potentially broad and long-lasting impact
      across physical, psychological, social and other areas of life. Its complex and
      diverse effects interact with ethnicity, gender, and refugee experience. Health
      and welfare agencies offer varied rehabilitation services, from conventional
      mental health treatment to eclectic or needs-based interventions. This review is 
      needed because relatively little outcome research has been done in this field,
      and no previous systematic review has been conducted. Resources are scarce, and
      the challenges of providing services can be considerable. OBJECTIVES: To assess
      beneficial and adverse effects of psychological, social and welfare interventions
      for torture survivors, and to compare these effects with those reported by active
      and inactive controls. SEARCH METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were
      identified through a search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression,
      Anxiety and Neurosis Specialised Register (CCDANCTR), the Latin American and
      Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), the Open System for
      Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE), the World Health
      Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and
      Published International Literature On Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) all years to 11
      April 2013; searches of Cochrane resources, international trial registries and
      the main biomedical databases were updated on 20 June 2014. We also searched the 
      Online Library of Dignity (Danish Institute against Torture), reference lists of 
      reviews and included studies and the most frequently cited journals, up to April 
      2013 but not repeated for 2014. Investigators were contacted to provide updates
      or details as necessary. SELECTION CRITERIA: Full publications of RCTs or
      quasi-RCTs of psychological, social or welfare interventions for survivors of
      torture against any active or inactive comparison condition. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: We included all major sources of grey literature in our search and used
      standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration for 
      collecting data, evaluating risk of bias and using GRADE (Grades of
      Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the
      quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included in this review. All
      were of psychological interventions; none provided social or welfare
      interventions. The nine trials provided data for 507 adults; none involved
      children or adolescents. Eight of the nine studies described individual
      treatment, and one discussed group treatment. Six trials were conducted in
      Europe, and three in different African countries. Most people were refugees in
      their thirties and forties; most met the criteria for post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) at the outset. Four trials used narrative exposure therapy (NET),
      one cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and the other four used mixed methods for
      trauma symptoms, one of which included reconciliation methods. Five interventions
      were compared with active controls, such as psychoeducation; four used treatment 
      as usual or waiting list/no treatment; we analysed all control conditions
      together. Duration of therapy varied from one hour to longer than 20 hours with a
      median of around 12 to 15 hours. All trials reported effects on distress and on
      PTSD, and two reported on quality of life. Five studies followed up participants 
      for at least six months.No immediate benefits of psychological therapy were noted
      in comparison with controls in terms of our primary outcome of distress (usually 
      depression), nor for PTSD symptoms, PTSD caseness, or quality of life. At
      six-month follow-up, three NET and one CBT study (86 participants) showed
      moderate effect sizes for intervention over control in reduction of distress
      (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to 
      -0.19) and of PTSD symptoms (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.07). However, the
      quality of evidence was very low, and risk of bias resulted from
      researcher/therapist allegiance to treatment methods, effects of uncertain asylum
      status of some people and real-time non-standardised translation of assessment
      measures. No measures of adverse events were described, nor of participation,
      social functioning, quantity of social or family relationships, proxy measures by
      third parties or satisfaction with treatment. Too few studies were identified for
      review authors to attempt sensitivity analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Very
      low-quality evidence suggests no differences between psychological therapies and 
      controls in terms of immediate effects on post-traumatic symptoms, distress or
      quality of life; however, NET and CBT were found to confer moderate benefits in
      reducing distress and PTSD symptoms over the medium term (six months after
      treatment). Evidence was of very low quality, mainly because non-standardised
      assessment methods using interpreters were applied, and sample sizes were very
      small. Most eligible trials also revealed medium to high risk of bias. Further,
      attention to the cultural appropriateness of interventions or to their
      psychometric qualities was inadequate, and assessment measures used were
      unsuitable. As such, these findings should be interpreted with caution.No data
      were available on whether symptom reduction enabled improvements in quality of
      life, participation in community life, or in social and family relationships in
      the medium term. Details of adverse events and treatment satisfaction were not
      available immediately after treatment nor in the medium term. Future research
      should aim to address these gaps in the evidence and should include larger sample
      sizes when possible. Problems of torture survivors need to be defined far more
      broadly than by PTSD symptoms, and recognition given to the contextual influences
      of being a torture survivor, including as an asylum seeker or refugee, on
      psychological and social health.

AB  - Fear extinction learning is a highly adaptive process that involves the integrity
      of frontolimbic circuitry. Its disruption has been associated with emotional
      dysregulation in stress and anxiety disorders. In this article we consider how
      age, genetics and experiences shape our capacity to regulate fear in
      cross-species studies. Evidence for adolescent-specific diminished fear
      extinction learning is presented in the context of immature frontolimbic
      circuitry. We also present evidence for less neural plasticity in fear regulation
      as a function of early-life stress and by genotype, focusing on the common brain 
      derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism. Finally, we discuss
      this work in the context of exposure-based behavioral therapies for the treatment
      of anxiety and stress disorders that are based on principles of fear extinction. 
      We conclude by speculating on how such therapies may be optimized for the
      individual based on the patient's age, genetic profile and personal history to
      move from standard treatment of care to personalized and precision medicine.

TI  - A systematic review of online youth mental health promotion and prevention
      interventions.
PG  - 90-113
LID - 10.1007/s10964-014-0165-0 [doi]
AB  - The rapid growth in the use of online technologies among youth provides an
      opportunity to increase access to evidence-based mental health resources. The aim
      of this systematic review is to provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence on 
      the effectiveness of online mental health promotion and prevention interventions 
      for youth aged 12-25 years. Searching a range of electronic databases, 28 studies
      conducted since 2000 were identified. Eight studies evaluating six mental health 
      promotion interventions and 20 studies evaluating 15 prevention interventions
      were reviewed. The results from the mental health promotion interventions
      indicate that there is some evidence that skills-based interventions presented in
      a module-based format can have a significant impact on adolescent mental health, 
      however, an insufficient number of studies limits this finding. The results from 
      the online prevention interventions indicate the significant positive effect of
      computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on adolescents' and emerging adults'
      anxiety and depression symptoms. The rates of non-completion were moderate to
      high across a number of studies. Implementation findings provide some evidence
      that participant face-to-face and/or web-based support was an important feature
      in terms of program completion and outcomes. Additional research examining
      factors affecting exposure, adherence and outcomes is required. The quality of
      evidence across the studies varied significantly, thus highlighting the need for 
      more rigorous, higher quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of 
      youth. Although future research is warranted, this study highlights the potential
      of online mental health promotion and prevention interventions in promoting youth
      wellbeing and reducing mental health problems.

AB  - This study extends support for a 5-day intensive exposure and response prevention
      (ERP) treatment protocol for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
      Twenty-two children with OCD received ERP treatment twice daily for 5 days. The
      treatment also emphasized teaching children and parents how to conduct ERP
      independently after they returned home. Symptoms were assessed at four
      time-points: Baseline, 4 weeks later at pre-treatment, one week after the
      intensive treatment 5-day treatment, and at 3 month follow-up. Changes on the
      primary outcome measure, clinician severity ratings on the Anxiety Disorders
      Interview Schedule for Children, and secondary measures, indicated that OCD
      symptoms remained stable from the evaluation to baseline and improved
      significantly from baseline to follow-up. Moreover, parental accommodation of OCD
      decreased significantly from baseline to post-treatment and from post-treatment
      to follow-up. These data suggest that the 5-day intervention demonstrates
      efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms and may initiate change in parent accommodation
      that continues to improve after the family returns home.

      therapy for youth anxiety.
PG  - 89
LID - 10.1186/s13012-014-0089-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Questions remain regarding the sustainment of evidence-based
      practices following implementation. The present study examined the sustainment of
      community clinicians' implementation (i.e., penetration) of cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy, attitudes toward evidence-based practices, and knowledge of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth anxiety two years following training and
      consultation in cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth anxiety. METHODS: Of the
      original 115 participants, 50 individuals (43%) participated in the two-year
      follow-up. A t- test examined sustainment in penetration over time. Hierarchical 
      linear modeling examined sustainment in knowledge and attitudes over time. Time
      spent in consultation sessions was examined as a potential moderator of the
      change in knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: Findings indicated sustained
      self-reported penetration of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxious youth, with
      low fidelity to some key CBT components (i.e., exposure tasks). Follow-up
      knowledge was higher than at baseline but lower than it had been immediately
      following the consultation phase of the study. Belief in the utility of
      evidence-based practices was sustained. Willingness to implement an
      evidence-based practice if required to do so, appeal of evidence-based practices,
      and openness toward evidence-based practices were not sustained. Participation in
      consultation positively moderated changes in knowledge and some attitudes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sustainment varied depending on the outcome examined. Generally,
      greater participation in consultation predicted greater sustainment. Implications
      for future training include higher dosages of consultation.

TI  - Does d-Cycloserine Augmentation of CBT Improve Therapeutic Homework Compliance
      for Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?
PG  - 863-871
AB  - Clinical studies in adults and children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
      have shown that d-cycloserine (DCS) can improve treatment response by enhancing
      fear extinction learning during exposure-based psychotherapy. Some have
      hypothesized that improved treatment response is a function of increased
      compliance and engagement in therapeutic homework tasks, a core component of
      behavioral treatment. The present study examined the relationship between DCS
      augmented cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and homework compliance in a
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial with 30 youth with OCD. All children
      received 10 CBT sessions, the last seven of which included exposure and response 
      prevention paired with DCS or placebo dosed 1 h before the session started.
      Results suggested that DCS augmented CBT did not predict improved homework
      compliance over the course of treatment, relative to the placebo augmented CBT
      group. However, when groups were collapsed, homework compliance was directly
      associated with treatment outcome. These findings suggest that while DCS may not 
      increase homework compliance over time, more generally, homework compliance is an
      integral part of pediatric OCD treatment outcome.

      (ASDs) through a virtual reality environment intervention.
PG  - e100374
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0100374 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Anxiety is common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD),
      with specific fears and phobias one of the most frequent subtypes. Specific fears
      and phobias can have a serious impact on young people with ASD and their
      families. In this study we developed and evaluated a unique treatment combining
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with graduated exposure in a virtual reality
      environment (VRE). Nine verbally fluent boys with an ASD diagnosis and no
      reported learning disability, aged 7 to 13 years old, were recruited. Each had
      anxiety around a specific situation (e.g. crowded buses) or stimulus (e.g.
      pigeons). An individualised scene was recreated in our 'wrap-around' VRE. In the 
      VRE participants were coached by a psychologist in cognitive and behavioural
      techniques (e.g. relaxation and breathing exercises) while the exposure to the
      phobia/fear stimulus was gradually increased as the child felt ready. Each child 
      received four 20-30 minute sessions. After participating in the study, eight of
      the nine children were able to tackle their phobia situation. Four of the
      participants completely overcame their phobia. Treatment effects were maintained 
      at 12 months. These results provide evidence that CBT with VRE can be a highly
      effective treatment for specific phobia/fear for some young people with ASD.

TI  - Rape-related symptoms in adolescents: short- and long-term outcome after
      cognitive behavior group therapy.
LID - 10.3402/ejpt.v5.22969 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficacy studies on treatment in adolescent victims of single rape
      are lacking, even though sexual victimization is most likely to occur during
      adolescence and despite the fact that adolescents are at risk to develop
      subsequent posttraumatic stress disorder. AIM: The aim of this prospective
      observational study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of a
      nine-session cognitive behavior group therapy (STEPS), including a parallel
      six-session parents' group on rape-related symptomatology in female adolescents
      (13-18 years). STEPS includes psychoeducation, exposure in sensu as well as in
      vivo, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention. METHODS: Fifty-five female
      adolescents with mental health problems due to single rape, but without prior
      sexual trauma, received STEPS while their parents participated in a support
      group. Subjects were assessed on posttraumatic stress (PTS) and comorbid symptoms
      using self-report questionnaires prior to and directly after treatment, and at 6 
      and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis showed a significant
      and large decrease in symptoms of PTS, anxiety, depression, anger, dissociation, 
      sexual concerns, and behavior problems directly after treatment, which maintained
      at 12 months follow-up. Time since trauma did not influence the results. Dropout 
      during STEPS was 1.8%. CONCLUSIONS: The results potentially suggest that the
      positive treatment outcomes at short- and long-term may be caused by STEPS. The
      encouraging findings need confirmation in future controlled studies on the
      effectiveness of STEPS because it may be possible that the treatment works
      especially well for more chronic symptoms, while the less chronic part of the
      sample showed considerable improvement on its own.

      pediatric posttraumatic stress.
PG  - 69-77
LID - 10.1089/cap.2013.0106 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Abstract Objective: Research on D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial
      N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) agonist, has suggested that it may enhance
      exposure-based therapies for anxiety disorders. RESULTS with DCS in adult
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been conflicting; however, no data have
      been reported on children with PTSD. Although many individuals with PTSD respond 
      to exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), there are subgroups of
      individuals who are nonresponders, and many responders still have substantial
      residual symptoms. This randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled study tested
      DCS as an adjunct to CBT to improve and speed treatment response for PTSD in
      youth. METHODS: Seven to 18 year-old youth with exposure to trauma and PTSD were 
      offered a 12 session, manualized CBT treatment. Those who remained in treatment
      at the fifth session were randomly allocated (n=57) to either CBT and DCS or CBT 
      and placebo. RESULTS: Youth in the CBT and DCS group had significant reductions
      in symptoms, but these reductions were not greater than those in the CBT and
      placebo group. There was a trend toward DCS speeding PTSD symptom recovery during
      the exposure-based sessions, and evidence that the CBT and DCS group better
      maintained stability of gains on inattention ratings from posttreatment to the 3 
      month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This initial study of CBT and DCS to treat
      pediatric PTSD provided suggestive and preliminary evidence for more rapid
      symptom recovery and beneficial effects on attention, but did not show an overall
      greater effect for reducing PTSD symptoms. It appears that augmentation with DCS 
      represents unique challenges in PTSD. Because PTSD involves complex,
      life-threatening trauma memories, as opposed to the imagined dreadful outcomes of
      other anxiety disorders, the use of DCS may require greater attention to how its 
      use is coupled with exposure-based techniques. DCS may have inadvertently
      enhanced reconsolidation of trauma memories rather than more positive and
      adaptive memories. In addition, the results suggest that future research could
      focus on the longer-term benefits of DCS on attention and ways to capitalize on
      attention-enhancing therapies. ClinicalTrials.gov registry: Effect of

TI  - Child disaster mental health interventions, part I: Techniques, outcomes, and
      methodological considerations.
PG  - 46-57
AB  - This review of child disaster mental health intervention studies describes the
      techniques used in the interventions and the outcomes addressed, and it provides 
      a preliminary evaluation of the field. The interventions reviewed here used a
      variety of strategies such as cognitive behavioral approaches, exposure and
      narrative techniques, relaxation, coping skill development, social support,
      psychoeducation, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and debriefing. A
      diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or posttraumatic stress
      reactions were the most commonly addressed outcomes although other reactions such
      as depression, anxiety, behavior problems, fear, and/or traumatic grief also were
      examined. Recommendations for future research are outlined.

AB  - A partial N-methyl-D-aspartate agonist, D-cycloserine, enhances fear extinction
      when given before or shortly after exposure to feared stimuli in animals. In this
      pilot double-blind placebo-controlled trial (trial number: ISRCTN70977225), 27
      youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder were randomised to either 50 mg
      D-cycloserine or placebo administered immediately after each of ten
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) sessions, primarily consisting of exposure
      and ritual prevention. Both groups improved significantly and maintained their
      gains at 1-year follow-up, with no significant advantage of D-cycloserine over
      placebo at any time point. The effects of CBT may not be augmented or accelerated
      when D-cycloserine is administered after sessions.

      and genetic factors governing fear regulation.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1111/nyas.12287 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting as many as
      10% of youth, with diagnoses peaking during adolescence. A core component of
      these disorders is an unremitting fear in the absence of present threat. One of
      the most commonly used therapies to treat these disorders is exposure-based
      cognitive behavioral therapy that identifies the source of the fear and anxiety
      and then desensitizes the individual to it. This treatment builds on basic
      principles of fear-extinction learning. A number of patients improve with this
      therapy, but 40-50% do not. This paper provides an overview of recent empirical
      studies employing both human imaging and cross-species behavioral genetics to
      examine how fear regulation varies across individuals and across development,
      especially during adolescence. These studies have important implications for
      understanding who may be at risk for anxiety disorders and for whom and when
      during development exposure-based therapies may be most effective.

TI  - Psychological therapies for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in
      children and adolescents (Review).
PG  - 1004-116
LID - 10.1002/ebch.1916 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children
      and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health
      costs. Although a wide range of psychological therapies have been used in the
      treatment of PTSD there are no systematic reviews of these therapies in children 
      and adolescents. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of psychological
      therapies in treating children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with PTSD.
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review 
      Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to December 2011. The CCDANCTR includes
      relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases:
      CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE 
      (1974 -), MEDLINE (1950 -) and PsycINFO (1967 -). We also checked reference lists
      of relevant studies and reviews. We applied no date or language restrictions.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies
      compared to a control, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or
      adolescents exposed to a traumatic event or diagnosed with PTSD. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Two members of the review group independently extracted data. If
      differences were identified, they were resolved by consensus, or referral to the 
      review team. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes, the
      standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) for both, using a fixed-effect model. If heterogeneity was found
      we used a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies including 758
      participants were included in this review. The types of trauma participants had
      been exposed to included sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic
      violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a
      trauma-related support service. The psychological therapies used in these studies
      were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure-based, psychodynamic,
      narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and
      reprocessing (EMDR). Most compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No
      study compared psychological therapies to pharmacological therapies alone or as
      an adjunct to a psychological therapy. Across all psychological therapies,
      improvement was significantly better (three studies, n = 80, OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.12
      to 15.85) and symptoms of PTSD (seven studies, n = 271, SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.24
      to -0.42), anxiety (three studies, n = 91, SMD -0.57, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.13) and 
      depression (five studies, n = 156, SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.36) were
      significantly lower within a month of completing psychological therapy compared
      to a control group. The psychological therapy for which there was the best
      evidence of effectiveness was CBT. Improvement was significantly better for up to
      a year following treatment (up to one month: two studies, n = 49, OR 8.64, 95% CI
      2.01 to 37.14; up to one year: one study, n = 25, OR 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69).
      PTSD symptom scores were also significantly lower for up to one year (up to one
      month: three studies, n = 98, SMD -1.34, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.89; up to one year:
      one study, n = 36, SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.01), and depression scores were 
      lower for up to a month (three studies, n = 98, SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.13)
      in the CBT group compared to a control. No adverse effects were identified. No
      study was rated as a high risk for selection or detection bias but a minority
      were rated as a high risk for attrition, reporting and other bias. Most included 
      studies were rated as an unclear risk for selection, detection and attrition
      bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for the effectiveness of
      psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for treating PTSD in children and
      adolescents for up to a month following treatment. At this stage, there is no
      clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to
      others. There is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and
      adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to
      psychological therapies than others. The findings of this review are limited by
      the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small
      size of identified studies. In addition, there was evidence of substantial
      heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or
      sensitivity analyses. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of all
      psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. Much more evidence
      is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological
      therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other
      treatments. More details are required in future trials in regards to the types of
      trauma that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD and whether the traumas are single
      event or ongoing. Future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and
      reliable measures of PTSD symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and
      sub-scores, are consistently reported.

TI  - Shape of change in cognitive behavioral therapy for youth anxiety: symptom
      trajectory and predictors of change.
PG  - 573-87
LID - 10.1037/a0033390 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multilevel growth analysis was used to establish the mean growth
      trajectory (shape of change) for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth
      with anxiety disorders. Two-level growth analysis was conducted to identify
      important between-youth predictors of session-by-session symptom change. METHOD: 
      Fifty-five youth (ages 7-17; 50.9% male) and their parents participated in a 16- 
      to 20-week CBT that emphasized affective, cognitive, and exposure-based
      exercises. Multilevel growth models (MLMs) were estimated to model session
      symptom data taking into account an "anxiety spike" hypothesized to occur at
      initiation of exposure sessions. Three models were compared: a cubic curve, a
      log-linear curve plus an exposure covariate, and a linear curve plus exposure
      covariate. Two-level MLM examined the effect of demographic traits (sex, age,
      race/ethnicity), pretreatment symptom severity, comorbid school refusal, early
      treatment factors (use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication,
      therapeutic alliance, treatment attrition), and pretreatment coping (engagement, 
      disengagement, and involuntary coping). RESULTS: Fit indices provided support for
      the cubic growth model using either parent or youth anxiety data. Level 2
      analysis identified youth age, symptom severity (anxiety, externalizing), early
      attrition, and engagement and disengagement coping as significant predictors of
      symptom trajectories. Predictors accounted for 34%-37% of between-youth variance 
      in midtreatment anxiety scores. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the symptom
      course of CBT, and the effect of between-youth factors on treatment outcomes, is 
      more complex than previously thought. Educating therapists and clients about
      findings can aid treatment expectations and dissemination efforts of empirically 
      supported treatments.

BTI - Interventions for the Prevention of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in
      Adults After Exposure to Psychological Trauma
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of
      psychological, pharmacological, and emerging interventions to prevent
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. DATA SOURCES: PubMed((R)), the
      Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, PILOTS, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts,
      PsycINFO((R)), Web of Science, reference lists of published literature (from
      January 1, 1980, to July 30, 2012). In addition, we searched various sources for 
      grey literature. REVIEW METHODS: Two investigators independently selected,
      extracted data from, and rated risk of bias of relevant studies. If data were
      sufficient, we conducted quantitative analyses using random-effects models to
      estimate pooled effects. We graded strength of evidence (SOE) based on
      established guidance. RESULTS: We included 19 trials with a range of populations 
      exposed to a variety of psychological traumas. Participants suffered from
      symptoms of PTSD but did not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. For most
      interventions studied, we did not find reliable evidence to support efficacy for 
      the prevention of PTSD or for the reduction of PTSD-related symptom severity.
      Evidence was sufficient to justify conclusions about three treatments. First,
      debriefing does not reduce either the incidence or the severity of PTSD or
      related psychological symptoms in civilian victims of crime, assault, or accident
      trauma (low SOE). Second, our meta-analyses of three trials showed that, in
      subjects with acute stress disorder, brief trauma-focused cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) was more effective than supportive counseling (SC) in reducing the 
      severity of PTSD (moderate SOE). Pooled results did not reach statistical
      significance for incidence of PTSD, depression symptom severity (both low SOE),
      and anxiety symptom severity (moderate SOE), but numerically favored CBT over SC.
      Finally, collaborative care for a traumatic injury requiring hospitalization
      produces a greater decrease in PTSD symptom severity at 6, 9, and 12 months after
      injury than does usual care (low SOE). The efficacy of psychological
      interventions to prevent PTSD did not differ between men and women (low SOE).
      Evidence was insufficient to determine whether previous depression or a history
      of child abuse or baseline PTSD symptoms influence the effectiveness of
      interventions. Evidence was insufficient to determine the effect of timing,
      intensity, or dosing on the effectiveness or risk of harms of interventions or to
      justify conclusions about the comparative risk of harms. For emerging
      interventions such as yoga, dietary supplements, and complementary or alternative
      interventions, no studies met our eligibility criteria. Evidence was insufficient
      to determine whether any treatment approaches were more effective for victims of 
      particular trauma types. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supporting the effectiveness of
      most interventions used to prevent PTSD is lacking. If available in a given
      setting, brief trauma-focused CBT might be the preferable choice for reducing
      PTSD symptom severity in persons with acute stress disorder and collaborative
      care might be preferred for trauma patients requiring surgical hospitalization;
      by contrast, debriefing appears to be an ineffective intervention to reduce
      symptoms and prevent PTSD.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy age effects in child and adolescent anxiety: an
      individual patient data metaanalysis.
PG  - 829-41
LID - 10.1002/da.22099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigations of age effects on youth anxiety outcomes in randomized
      trials (RCTs) of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) have failed to yield a clear
      result due to inadequate statistical power and methodologic weaknesses. We
      conducted an individual patient data metaanalysis to address this gap. QUESTION: 
      Does age moderate CBT effect size, measured by a clinically and statistically
      significant interaction between age and CBT exposure? METHODS: All English
      language RCTs of CBT for anxiety in 6-19 year olds were identified using
      systematic review methods. Investigators of eligible trials were invited to
      submit their individual patient data. The anxiety disorder interview schedule
      (ADIS) primary diagnosis severity score was the primary outcome. Age effects were
      investigated using multilevel modeling to account for study level data clustering
      and random effects. RESULTS: Data from 17 of 23 eligible trials were obtained
      (74%); 16 studies and 1,171 (78%) cases were available for the analysis. No
      interaction between age and CBT exposure was found in a model containing age,
      sex, ADIS baseline severity score, and comorbid depression diagnosis (power >/=
      80%). Sensitivity analyses, including modeling age as both a categorical and
      continuous variable, revealed this result was robust. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents
      who receive CBT in efficacy research studies show benefits comparable to younger 
      children. However, CBT protocol modifications routinely carried out by expert
      trial therapists may explain these findings. Adolescent CBT protocols are needed 
      to facilitate the transportability of efficacy research effects to usual care
      settings where therapists may have less opportunity for CBT training and
      expertise development.

AB  - Multilevel growth analysis was used to establish the shape of change (mean growth
      trajectory) for youth- and therapist-rated alliance in cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) for anxious youth and to identify between-youth predictors of
      alliance trajectory. Youth (N = 69; ages 7-17; 52.2% female) and their parents
      participated in an empirically supported CBT protocol. Therapists rated alliance 
      each session and youth every four sessions. Data were fit to four growth models: 
      linear, quadratic, a dual slope, and a novel "alliance rupture" model. Two-level 
      models were estimated to examine the effect of youth age, sex, pretreatment
      symptom severity, diagnostic comorbidity, early treatment factors (use of
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), and coping styles (engagement,
      disengagement, and involuntary coping). A dual slope model fit therapist data
      best, whereas youth data did not evidence systematic growth. Two-level growth
      models identified that pretreatment anxiety severity predicted higher initial
      alliance levels. Depressive symptoms predicted less linear growth and engagement 
      coping predicted greater growth during exposure sessions. No variables predicted 
      preexposure growth. In the therapist model, 22% of initial alliance, 50% of
      preexposure growth, and 75% of postexposure growth were accounted for by between 
      youth variables (mood disorder, anxiety and depression symptoms, engagement and
      involuntary coping). Therapist-reported alliance ratings may grow over the course
      of manual-based CBT, even during exposure-focused sessions. Pretreatment youth
      factors and coping style may influence the absolute value and linear trajectory
      of alliance during CBT. Findings about alliance-influencing factors can help set 
      expectations for, and enhance training in, empirically supported treatments.

AB  - The evidence base for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat child emotional
      and behavioral symptoms following exposure to trauma in youth is compelling, but 
      relatively few studies are available on preschool children and on moderators of
      treatment outcomes. This paper examines maternal and child characteristics as
      moderators of posttraumatic stress (PTS) treatment outcomes in preschool
      children. Outcome data from a previously published randomized trial in three to
      six year old preschool children with diagnostic interview data from participating
      mothers were used. Hypotheses were tested via hierarchical linear modeling.
      Maternal depression was associated with higher initial child posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and was associated with increasing PTSD symptom trends 
      at follow up suggesting potential child PTSD symptom relapse. Maternal PTSD
      symptoms similarly predicted differential child separation anxiety symptom change
      but not child PTSD symptom change. Targeting dyads with child PTSD symptoms and
      maternal depression or PTSD symptoms with enhanced interventions may be a useful 
      strategy to improve treatment maintenance.

TI  - Evidence-based treatments for children with trauma-related psychopathology as a
      result of childhood maltreatment: a systematic review.
PG  - 269-83
LID - 10.1007/s00787-012-0367-5 [doi]
AB  - This is a systematic review of evidence-based treatments for children exposed to 
      childhood maltreatment. Because exposure to childhood maltreatment has been
      associated with a broad range of trauma-related psychopathology (e.g., PTSD,
      anxiety, suicidal ideation, substance abuse) and with aggressive and violent
      behavior, this review describes psychotherapeutic treatments which focus on
      former broad range of psychopathological outcomes. A total of 26 randomized
      controlled clinical trials and seven non-randomized controlled clinical trials
      published between 2000 and 2012 satisfied the inclusionary criteria and were
      included. These studies dealt with various kinds of samples, from sexually abused
      and maltreated children in child psychiatric outpatient clinics or in foster care
      to traumatized incarcerated boys. A total of 27 studies evaluated
      psychotherapeutic treatments which used trauma-focused cognitive, behavioral or
      cognitive-behavioral techniques; only two studies evaluated trauma-specific
      treatments for children and adolescents with comorbid aggressive or violent
      behavior; and four studies evaluated psychotherapeutic treatments that
      predominantly focused on other mental health problems than PTSD and used
      non-trauma focused cognitive, behavioral or cognitive-behavioral techniques. The 
      results of this review suggest that trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy
      (TF-CBT) is the best-supported treatment for children following childhood
      maltreatment. However, in line with increased interest in the diagnosis of
      complex PTSD and given the likely relationship between childhood maltreatment and
      aggressive and violent behavior, the authors suggest that clinical practice
      should address a phase-oriented approach. This review concludes with a discussion
      of future research directions and limitations.

      children and adolescents.
PG  - CD006726

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children
      and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health
      costs. Although a wide range of psychological therapies have been used in the
      treatment of PTSD there are no systematic reviews of these therapies in children 
      and adolescents. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of psychological
      therapies in treating children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with PTSD.
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review 
      Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to December 2011. The CCDANCTR includes
      relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases:
      CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE 
      (1974 -), MEDLINE (1950 -) and PsycINFO (1967 -). We also checked reference lists
      of relevant studies and reviews. We applied no date or language restrictions.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies
      compared to a control, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or
      adolescents exposed to a traumatic event or diagnosed with PTSD. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Two members of the review group independently extracted data. If
      differences were identified, they were resolved by consensus, or referral to the 
      review team.We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes, the
      standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) for both, using a fixed-effect model. If heterogeneity was found
      we used a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies including 758
      participants were included in this review. The types of trauma participants had
      been exposed to included sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic
      violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a
      trauma-related support service.The psychological therapies used in these studies 
      were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure-based, psychodynamic,
      narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and
      reprocessing (EMDR). Most compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No
      study compared psychological therapies to pharmacological therapies alone or as
      an adjunct to a psychological therapy.Across all psychological therapies,
      improvement was significantly better (three studies, n = 80, OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.12
      to 15.85) and symptoms of PTSD (seven studies, n = 271, SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.24
      to -0.42), anxiety (three studies, n = 91, SMD -0.57, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.13) and 
      depression (five studies, n = 156, SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.36) were
      significantly lower within a month of completing psychological therapy compared
      to a control group.The psychological therapy for which there was the best
      evidence of effectiveness was CBT. Improvement was significantly better for up to
      a year following treatment (up to one month: two studies, n = 49, OR 8.64, 95% CI
      2.01 to 37.14; up to one year: one study, n = 25, OR 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69).
      PTSD symptom scores were also significantly lower for up to one year (up to one
      month: three studies, n = 98, SMD -1.34, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.89; up to one year:
      one study, n = 36, SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.01), and depression scores were 
      lower for up to a month (three studies, n = 98, SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.13)
      in the CBT group compared to a control. No adverse effects were identified.No
      study was rated as a high risk for selection or detection bias but a minority
      were rated as a high risk for attrition, reporting and other bias. Most included 
      studies were rated as an unclear risk for selection, detection and attrition
      bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for the effectiveness of
      psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for treating PTSD in children and
      adolescents for up to a month following treatment. At this stage, there is no
      clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to
      others. There is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and
      adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to
      psychological therapies than others.The findings of this review are limited by
      the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small
      size of identified studies. In addition, there was evidence of substantial
      heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or
      sensitivity analyses.More evidence is required for the effectiveness of all
      psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. Much more evidence
      is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological
      therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other
      treatments. More details are required in future trials in regards to the types of
      trauma that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD and whether the traumas are single
      event or ongoing. Future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and
      reliable measures of PTSD symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and
      sub-scores, are consistently reported.

TI  - [Treating specific childhood phobia in a single session? A systematic review of
      the literature].

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The essential feature of specific phobia is a persistent fear of
      clearly discernable, circumscribed objects or situations. The DSM-IV
      distinguishes four subtypes: animal, natural environment, blood-injection-injury,
      and situational. Specific phobias frequently co-occur. Specific phobia is one of 
      the most common psychiatric disorders with a lifetime prevalence of 12.5% and is 
      about twice as common in women as in men. Most phobias have a childhood onset
      except for the situational subtype which usually occurs during patients'
      twenties. It is well known that childhood anxiety increases the risk of
      psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety in later life, as well as
      the risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalization. Nonetheless, there 
      are few studies on the psychobiology and pharmacotherapy of specific phobias.
      Neuroimaging studies have shown that specific phobia seems to be associated with 
      amygdala (more specifically the right amygdala) and anterior cingulate cortex
      hyperactivation that is reduced after exposure therapy. The aim of this study is 
      to propose the first systematic review of specific phobia treatment among
      children. METHOD: The review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Two databases (Medline
      and Web of Science) were searched combining the search terms: specific phobia and
      treatment. English and French language were imposed. There were no publication
      date or publication status limitations. Seventy-four studies met the inclusion
      criteria and 36 were included. RESULTS: The goal of treatment is to achieve
      habituation and eventual extinction of the phobic reaction. Treatments for
      children's anxiety have been suggested to work through diverse processes such as 
      counter-conditioning, extinction, habituation, change in catastrophic cognitions,
      development of coping skills, increased self-efficacy, emotional processing, and 
      changes in expectancies and perceptions of dangerousness. Most phobias respond
      robustly to in vivo exposure, but this approach is associated with high dropout
      rates and low treatment acceptance. One Session Treatment, a variant of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, combines graduated in vivo exposure, participant
      modeling, reinforcement, psychoeducation, cognitive challenges, and skills
      training in an intensive treatment model. The limited data available on
      medication shows little promise. Finally, relapse is a common phenomenon, and
      little is known on the long-term outcome of the illness.

TI  - Evidence-based behavioral treatment of dog phobia with young children: two case
      examples.
PG  - 143-60
LID - 10.1177/0145445512458524 [doi]
AB  - Specific phobias are among the most common anxiety disorders, especially in
      children. Unfortunately, a paucity of literature exists regarding the treatment
      of specific phobia in young children, despite the knowledge that traditional
      techniques (i.e., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) may not be practical.
      Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present two case studies that
      provide empirical support for the evidence-based behavioral treatment of specific
      phobia with young children (ages 4 and 5 years). Results indicated that following
      10 to 13 sessions of graduated exposure therapy using reinforced practice and
      participant modeling, the children no longer met criteria for clinically
      significant phobias of dogs. Treatment effects were maintained at 7-month
      follow-up despite reported lack of practice and/or regular exposure to dogs in
      the children's daily lives.

TI  - Are exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapies safe during pregnancy?
PG  - 445-57
LID - 10.1007/s00737-012-0308-9 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders during pregnancy are highly prevalent and associated with
      serious and enduring consequences for both mother and child. Exposure-based
      cognitive behavioral (CBT) and behavioral therapies (BT) represent the most
      empirically supported psychosocial treatments for anxiety disorders in general
      adult samples. Pregnant women, however, generally have been excluded from this
      body of research. Evidence that pregnant women inhabit a unique biological
      context combined with untested assumptions that exposure would unduly stress or
      harm the fetus have likely prohibited inquiry. This paper seeks to remedy this
      gap by integrating findings from obstetric, psychiatric, and psychological
      research to inform central questions regarding exposure-based treatment of
      anxiety disorders during pregnancy. Based on available evidence, we consider the 
      potential risks and benefits of CBT/BT for anxiety disorders during pregnancy
      relative to other currently available treatment options. From a multidisciplinary
      research perspective, we argue that exposure-based therapies are likely to be
      safe during pregnancy, particularly relative to the alternatives. However, we
      also highlight critical questions for future research to directly test the
      biopsychological impact of exposure-based therapies among pregnant women.

TI  - Treating Anxiety Disorders in Inner City Schools: Results from a Pilot Randomized
      Controlled Trial Comparing CBT and Usual Care.
PG  - 1-19
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) in inner
      city schools, when delivered by novice CBT clinicians, and compared to usual care
      (UC), is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study addressed this issue by comparing a
      modular CBT for anxiety disorders to UC in a sample of 32 volunteer youth (mean
      age 10.28 years, 63% female, 84% African American) seen in school-based mental
      health programs. METHODS: Youth were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 17) or UC (n =
      15); independent evaluators conducted diagnostic interviews with children and
      parents at pre- and post-intervention, and at a one-month follow-up. RESULTS:
      Based on intent-to-treat analyses, no differences were found in response rates
      between groups with 50 and 42% of the children in CBT, compared to 46 and 57% in 
      UC no longer meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder at post-treatment and
      follow-up respectively. Similar improvements in global functioning were also
      found in both treatment groups. Baseline predictors of a positive treatment
      response included lower anxiety, fewer maladaptive thoughts, less exposure to
      urban hassles, and lower levels of parenting stress. Therapist use of more CBT
      session structure elements and greater competence in implementing these elements 
      was also related to a positive treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from
      this small pilot failed to show that CBT was superior to UC when delivered by
      school-based clinicians. Large scale comparative effectiveness trials are needed 
      to determine whether CBT leads to superior clinical outcomes prior to
      dissemination.

TI  - CBT Specific Process in Exposure-Based Treatments: Initial Examination in a
      Pediatric OCD Sample.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - Cognitive-Behavioral theory and empirical support suggest that optimal activation
      of fear is a critical component for successful exposure treatment. Using this
      theory, we developed coding methodology for measuring CBT-specific process during
      exposure. We piloted this methodology in a sample of young children (N = 18) who 
      previously received CBT as part of a randomized controlled trial. Results
      supported the preliminary reliability and predictive validity of coding variables
      with 12 week and 3 month treatment outcome data, generally showing results
      consistent with CBT theory. However, given our limited and restricted sample,
      additional testing is warranted. Measurement of CBT-specific process using this
      methodology may have implications for understanding mechanism of change in
      exposure-based treatments and for improving dissemination efforts through
      identification of therapist behaviors associated with improved outcome.

AB  - Neurobiological studies have demonstrated that psychotherapy is able to alter
      brain function in adults, however little exists on this topic with respect to
      children. This waiting-list controlled investigation focused on therapy-related
      changes of the P300 and the late positive potential (LPP) in 8- to 13-year-old
      spider phobic girls. Thirty-two patients were presented with phobia-relevant,
      generally disgust-inducing, fear-inducing, and affectively neutral pictures while
      an electroencephalogram was recorded. Participants received one session of up to 
      4h of cognitive-behavioral exposure therapy. Treated children showed enhanced
      amplitudes of the LPP at frontal sites in response to spider pictures. This
      result is interpreted to reflect an improvement in controlled attentional
      engagement and is in line with already existing data for adult females. Moreover,
      the girls showed a therapy-specific reduction in overall disgust proneness, as
      well as in experienced arousal and disgust when viewing disgust pictures. Thus,
      exposure therapy seems to have broad effects in children.

TI  - Anxiety in anorexia nervosa and its management using family-based treatment.
PG  - e1-16
LID - 10.1002/erv.1071 [doi]
AB  - Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by its similarity to anxiety disorders,
      especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Family-based treatment (FBT) has 
      shown promising initial results for treatment of AN in adolescents, yet the
      precise mechanisms of action are unknown. We present a theoretical argument and
      model, suggesting that FBT may work via exposure (and habituation) to food and
      its consumption. First, we review the evidence for pathological anxiety in AN,
      and suggest a framework for identifying specific anxious triggers, emotions (fear
      and worry) and avoidance strategies. Second, we briefly review evidence
      indicating that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and specifically exposure in 
      its various forms is most effective for treating anxiety disorders in youth.
      Third, we consider distinct approaches to exposure therapy based on the pattern
      of triggers, anxious emotions and avoidance. We conclude that the interventions
      utilized in FBT share clear similarities to exposure with response prevention, a 
      type of exposure therapy commonly used with OCD, and may work via facilitating
      habituation to food and eating in one's natural environment. We also highlight
      how parents facilitate this process in between sessions by effectively coaching
      their children and facilitating naturalistic exposure to food and related
      triggers. Options for future research are considered.

      hyperarousal. Although the condition is well established in adults, there is
      little research into PTSD in children and adolescents. The available research
      shows that young people experience similar symptoms to adults. Risk factors
      include family dysfunction, peer problems, greater exposure to the trauma and the
      presence of pre-existing psychiatric disorder such as anxiety. Protective factors
      include good coping skills, good relationship with a parent and support from
      others in the community. This article reviews treatment approaches to PTSD in
      young people in particular the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

TI  - [Separation anxiety family therapy (SAFT): a cognitive behavioral treatment
      program for children suffering from separation anxiety].
PG  - 684-90
AB  - Separation Anxiety Disorder is one oft the most frequent mental disorders in
      children. The SAFT treatment manual is an evidence-based cognitive behavioral
      therapy program for children with separation anxiety. Its first part consists of 
      four weekly sessions with the child and four weekly sessions with the parents.
      Children and parents receive psychoeducation about anxiety, learn to recognize
      and reframe irrational beliefs about separation situations, expand their
      repertoire of coping strategies, and are introduced to the rationale for
      exposure. The second part of treatment consists of eight weekly family sessions
      followed by a short parent-only session. During the family sessions, exposure in 
      vivo is planned and practiced. The parent-only portions of the family sessions
      involve reframing parental irrational beliefs about separation, parenting
      strategies and practicing parental behavior during exposure. Evaluation data
      shows that disorder-specific family-based therapy (SAFT) results in improvement
      compared with waiting list controls.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic anxiety disorder. While
      medication and psychotherapy advances have been very helpful to patients, many
      patients do not respond adequately to initial trials of serotonergic medication
      or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and require multiple treatment trials or
      combination therapies. Comorbidity may also influence treatment response. The
      role of streptococcal infections in pediatric OCD has become an area of intense
      scrutiny and controversy. In this article, current treatment methods for OCD will
      be reviewed, with special attention to strategies for treating OCD in children
      and in patients with comorbid tic disorders. Alternative psychotherapy strategies
      for patients who are highly anxious about starting CBT, such as cognitive therapy
      or augmentation with D-cycloserine, will be reviewed. Newer issues regarding use 
      of antibiotics, neuroleptics, and glutamate modulators in OCD treatment will also
      be explored.

PG  - 327-37
LID - 10.1007/s10802-011-9566-7 [doi]
AB  - The present study compared the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavior
      therapy (CBT) with trauma-focused cognitive therapy (without exposure; CT) for
      children and youth with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Children and youth 
      who had experienced single-incident trauma (N = 33; 7-17 years old) were randomly
      assigned to receive 9 weeks of either CBT or CT which was administered
      individually to children and their parents. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated
      that both interventions significantly reduced severity of PTSD, depression, and
      general anxiety. At posttreatment 65% of CBT and 56% of the CT group no longer
      met criteria for PTSD. Treatment completers showed a better response (CBT: 91%;
      CT: 90%), and gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Maternal depressive
      symptoms and unhelpful trauma beliefs moderated children's outcome. It is
      concluded that PTSD secondary to single-incident trauma can be successfully
      treated with trauma-focused cognitive behavioural methods and the use of exposure
      is not a prerequisite for good outcome.

TI  - Trauma-focused CBT for youth who experience ongoing traumas.
PG  - 637-46
LID - 10.1016/j.chiabu.2011.05.002 [doi]
AB  - Many youth experience ongoing trauma exposure, such as domestic or community
      violence. Clinicians often ask whether evidence-based treatments containing
      exposure components to reduce learned fear responses to historical trauma are
      appropriate for these youth. Essentially the question is, if youth are
      desensitized to their trauma experiences, will this in some way impair their
      responding to current or ongoing trauma? The paper addresses practical strategies
      for implementing one evidence-based treatment, Trauma-Focused Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for youth with ongoing traumas. Collaboration with
      local therapists and families participating in TF-CBT community and international
      programs elucidated effective strategies for applying TF-CBT with these youth.
      These strategies included: (1) enhancing safety early in treatment; (2)
      effectively engaging parents who experience personal ongoing trauma; and (3)
      during the trauma narrative and processing component focusing on (a) increasing
      parental awareness and acceptance of the extent of the youths' ongoing trauma
      experiences; (b) addressing youths' maladaptive cognitions about ongoing traumas;
      and (c) helping youth differentiate between real danger and generalized trauma
      reminders. Case examples illustrate how to use these strategies in diverse
      clinical situations. Through these strategies TF-CBT clinicians can effectively
      improve outcomes for youth experiencing ongoing traumas.

AB  - We compared the effects of a 16-week Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program
      and a Social Recreational (SR) program on anxiety in children with Autism
      Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Seventy children (9-16 years old) were randomly
      assigned to either of the programs (n (CBT) = 36; n (SR) = 34). Measures on
      child's anxiety using the Spence Child Anxiety Scale--Child (SCAS-C) and the
      Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI--S) were administered at pre-,
      post-treatment, and follow-ups (3- and 6-month). Children in both programs showed
      significantly lower levels of generalized anxiety and total anxiety symptoms at
      6-month follow-up on SCAS-C. Clinician ratings on the CGI-S demonstrated an
      increase in the percentage of participants rated as "Normal" and "Borderline" for
      both programs. Findings from the present study suggest factors such as regular
      sessions in a structured setting, consistent therapists, social exposure and the 
      use of autism-friendly strategies are important components of an effective
      framework in the management of anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD.

AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) have been shown to be efficacious for the
      treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Randomized clinical
      trials indicate that approximately two-thirds of children treated with CBT will
      be free of their primary diagnosis at posttreatment. Although several CBT
      treatment packages have been investigated in youth with diverse anxiety
      disorders, common core components have been identified. A comprehensive
      assessment, development of a good therapeutic relationship and working alliance, 
      cognitive restructuring, repeated exposure with reduction of avoidance behavior, 
      and skills training comprise the core procedures for the treatment of anxiety
      disorders in youth.

AB  - Selective mutism is a rare, debilitating condition usually seen in children.
      Unfortunately, there is little research examining effective treatments for this
      disorder, and designing an evidence-based treatment plan can be difficult. This
      case study presents the evidence-based treatment of an 8-year-old Caucasian boy
      with selective mutism using an established treatment for anxiety--Modular
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Childhood Anxiety Disorders (Chorpita, 2007).
      The treatment consisted of 21 sessions and included modules on psychoeducation,
      exposure, cognitive restructuring, social skills, and maintenance and relapse
      prevention. The client's symptoms were greatly improved by the end of treatment
      based on fear hierarchy ratings, self-report and parent-report questionnaires,
      and child and parent clinical interviews. In addition, at discharge the client no
      longer met criteria for selective mutism. Improvements were maintained when the
      client was reassessed at 1-month and 6-month follow-up appointments.

      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the amygdala, as a method to enhance exposure
      therapy outcome. Preliminary results have supported the use of DCS to augment
      exposure therapy in adult anxiety disorders; however, no data have been reported 
      in any childhood anxiety disorder. Thus, we sought to preliminarily examine
      whether weight-adjusted DCS doses (25 or 50 mg) enhanced the overall efficacy of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD). METHOD: Participants were 30 youth (aged 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of
      OCD. The study design was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
      augmentation trial examining CBT + DCS versus CBT + Placebo (15 youth per group).
      All patients received seven exposure and response prevention sessions paired with
      DCS or placebo taken 1 hour before sessions. RESULTS: Although not significantly 
      different, compared with the CBT + Placebo group, youth in the CBT + DCS arm
      showed small-to-moderate treatment effects (d = .31-.47 on primary outcomes). No 
      adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These results complement findings in
      adult OCD and non-OCD anxiety disorders and provide initial support for a more
      extensive study of DCS augmentation of CBT among youth with OCD.

AB  - Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were assessed (Social Responsiveness
      Scale-Parent (SRS-P); coded in-session behavior) in typically-developing,
      anxiety-disordered children (N = 50) treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy
      (CBT). Study 1: children with moderate autistic symptomology (per SRS-P) were
      significantly more likely to improve from family CBT (FCBT) than individual CBT
      (ICBT; OR = 8.67). Coded behavior did not predict outcome. Study 2: CBT
      components were compared by treatment and ASD symptom status. At-home exposure
      completion was greater in FCBT and there was an interaction in child involvement 
      for treatment and ASD status. Though both treatments reduced anxiety, FCBT
      outperformed ICBT for children with moderate ASD symptoms, a benefit potentially 
      linked to more at-home exposures and greater child involvement in FCBT.

TI  - Combined pharmacotherapy and psychological therapies for post traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD).
PG  - CD007316
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007316.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PTSD is an anxiety disorder related to exposure to a severe
      psychological trauma. Symptoms include re-experiencing the event, avoidance and
      arousal as well as distress and impairment resulting from these
      symptoms.Guidelines suggest a combination of both psychological therapy and
      pharmacotherapy may enhance treatment response, especially in those with more
      severe PTSD or in those who have not responded to either intervention alone.
      OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the combination of psychological therapy and
      pharmacotherapy provides a more efficacious treatment for PTSD than either of
      these interventions delivered separately. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches were
      conducted on the trial registers kept by the CCDAN group (CCDANCTR-Studies and
      CCDANCTR-References) to June 2010. The reference sections of included studies and
      several conference abstracts were also scanned. SELECTION CRITERIA: Patients of
      any age or gender, with chronic or recent onset PTSD arising from any type of
      event relevant to the diagnostic criteria were included. A combination of any
      psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy was included and compared to wait list,
      placebo, standard treatment or either intervention alone. The primary outcome was
      change in total PTSD symptom severity. Other outcomes included changes in
      functioning, depression and anxiety symptoms, suicide attempts, substance use,
      withdrawal and cost. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two or three review authors
      independently selected trials, assessed their 'risk of bias' and extracted trial 
      and outcome data. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. The relative
      risk was used to summarise dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference and
      standardised mean difference were used to summarise continuous measures. MAIN
      RESULTS: Four trials were eligible for inclusion, one of these trials (n =24) was
      on children and adolescents. All used an SSRI and prolonged exposure or a
      cognitive behavioural intervention. Two trials compared combination treatment
      with pharmacological treatment and two compared combination treatment with
      psychological treatment. Only two trials reported a total PTSD symptom score and 
      these data could not be combined. There was no strong evidence to show if there
      were differences between the group receiving combined interventions compared to
      the group receiving psychological therapy (mean difference 2.44, 95% CI -2.87,
      7.35 one study, n=65) or pharmacotherapy (mean difference -4.70, 95% CI -10.84 to
      1.44; one study, n = 25). Trialists reported no significant differences between
      combination and single intervention groups in the other two studies. There were
      very little data reported for other outcomes, and in no case were significant
      differences reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence
      available to support or refute the effectiveness of combined psychological
      therapy and pharmacotherapy compared to either of these interventions alone.
      Further large randomised controlled trials are urgently required.

PG  - 497-504
LID - 10.1017/S1352465810000287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) ratings are commonly used
      during exposure tasks in cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety. AIMS: 
      The present study examined patterns and predictors of SUDS in a sample of
      anxiety-disordered youth. METHOD: Youth (N = 99) aged 7 to 14 (M = 10.4, SD =
      1.8) were treated with CBT for social phobia (SP), generalized anxiety disorder
      (GAD), and/or separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Analyses were conducted using
      hierarchical linear modeling. RESULTS: Child's peak SUDS and magnitude of change 
      in SUDS significantly increased between sessions. Higher child self-reported
      pretreatment total Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) score
      predicted greater change in SUDS within the first exposure session. Primary GAD
      diagnosis predicted less increase in change in SUDS between sessions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that higher pretreatment total MASC scores are
      associated with increased first exposure within-session habituation.
      Additionally, youth with a principal diagnosis of GAD experienced less
      between-session habituation, perhaps because they may have required more imaginal
      than in-vivo exposures.

      on anxiety and secondary disorders in young adulthood.
PG  - 924-34
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02242.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study's aim was to examine the long-term effects (8 to 13
      years post-treatment; M = 9.83 years; SD = 1.71) of the most widely used
      treatment approaches of exposure-based cognitive behavioral treatment for phobic 
      and anxiety disorders in children and adolescents (i.e., group treatment and two 
      variants of individual treatment). An additional aim was to compare the relative 
      long-term efficacy of the treatment approaches. METHOD: At long-term follow-up,
      participants (N = 67) were between 16 and 26 years of age (M = 19.43 years, SD = 
      3.02). Primary outcome was the targeted anxiety disorder and targeted symptoms.
      Secondary outcomes were other disorders and symptoms not directly targeted in the
      treatments including (1) other anxiety disorders and symptoms, (2) depressive
      disorders and symptoms, and (3) substance use disorders and symptoms. RESULTS:
      Long-term remission for anxiety disorders and symptoms targeted in the treatments
      was evident 8 to 13 years post-treatment. Long-term remission also was found for 
      the secondary outcomes. There were more similarities than differences in the
      long-term gains when comparing the treatment approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent 
      with past research, the study's findings provide further evidence that the
      short-term benefits of exposure-based CBT for childhood phobic and anxiety
      disorders using both group and individual treatment may extend into the critical 
      transition years of young adulthood.

PG  - 581-92
AB  - The subject of the paper is the presentation of simple phobias, with particular
      attention to those connected with natural environment, their classification
      according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV systems, current views on aetiology and
      pathogenesis of phobic fear, as well as treatment methods. Among pathogenic
      factors of simple phobia, genetic predisposition, harmful environmental factors
      in early childhood and intrapsychic conflicts have been considered. In the paper,
      the results of neuroimaging studies in phobic patients were also presented as
      well as evolutionary aspects leading to persisting predisposition to phobic
      traits in the population. Epidemiologic studies point to a marked prevalence of
      simple phobias. Psychotherapy is regarded a basic treatment method for simple
      phobias: in-vivo exposure and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been proved
      effective. The case report of a hospitalized patient with wind phobia
      (ancraophobia) supplements the theoretical part. Clinical observation allowed for
      a detailed identification of symptoms of the disorder and selection of
      pharmacological treatment complementary to psychotherapy. A substantial
      improvement has been obtained in the patient described after combination
      treatment with psychoanalytic therapy and paroxetine, 20 mg per day.

      training, cognitive restructuring and exposure components. To recruit the
      participants for the intervention program screening tests were applied to 711
      students of three different junior high schools in Izmir. 44 students
      (treatment=24, control= 20) who met the inclusion criteria in the seventh and
      eighth grades participated in the main study. Evaluation of the therapy program
      was ascertained using the following instruments; for students, Negative Cognitive
      Errors Questionnaire (CNCEQ), Cape Social Phobia Scale for Children and
      Adolescents (CSPSCA), Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A); and for
      parents, (SAS-P) was used to compare their pre-program and post-program tests
      results. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVAs yielded significant Group X Time
      interactions for SAS-A (F (1, 42) =7.511, p< 0.01, eta2 =0.15), CSPSCA (F (1, 42)
      =6.54, p<.05) and CNCEQ (F (1, 42) = 8.295, p<0.01, eta2 =0.16) scores. Results
      from parents further indicated that social anxiety in the treatment group had
      decreased after program completion (F (1, 42) = 9.496, p=0.004, eta2 =0.18).
      CONCLUSION: Consistent with the literature of school based Cognitive-Behavioral
      Group Treatment (CBGT) programs for social anxiety, it was found that adolescents
      in the treatment group exhibited a significant decrease in social anxiety and
      related cognitive errors.

LID - 10.1007/s10803-009-0791-7 [doi]
AB  - This pilot study tested the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on
      parent-reported autism symptoms. Nineteen children with autism spectrum disorders
      and an anxiety disorder (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of
      CBT or a waitlist condition. The CBT program emphasized in vivo exposure
      supported by parent training and school consultation to promote social
      communication and emotion regulation skills. Parents completed a standardized
      autism symptom checklist at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist and 3-month
      follow-up assessments. CBT outperformed the waitlist condition at
      posttreatment/postwaitlist on total parent-reported autism symptoms (Cohen's d
      effect size = .77). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Further
      investigation of this intervention modality with larger samples and broader
      outcome measures appears to be indicated.

LID - 10.1080/15374410802581055 [doi]
AB  - This study examined child behavior during exposure tasks and characteristics of
      the exposure tasks as related to outcomes when treating anxious youth.
      Participants (aged 7-13) were 87 anxiety-disordered children (37 girls; 50 boys) 
      and their parents (84 mothers; 70 fathers) who completed a 16-session
      cognitive-behavioral therapy. Videotapes of exposure-based sessions were coded
      for (a) child use of safety-seeking behavior (SSB) and (b) coping behavior (CB)
      during exposure, (c) characteristics of the exposure tasks, and (d) child anxiety
      during exposure. Results indicated that child use of SSB, but not CB, during
      exposure was significantly predictive of poorer outcome. SSB was greater during
      exposure tasks for treatment nonresponders than for responders, whereas CB was
      greater for treatment responders. SSB increased over the course of exposure-based
      sessions, whereas CB remained stable. Child anxiety during exposure tasks and
      most exposure task characteristics were not significantly predictive of outcome.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy in childhood anxiety.
PG  - 282-9
AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common childhood disorders. They tend to be
      chronic and to cause significant impairment. In this article, we review the
      scientific basis of cognitive behavioral therapy in treating childhood anxiety
      disorders. We describe the assessment process and its use throughout the
      treatment. An outline of the central principles of applying cognitive behavioral 
      interventions in the treatment of children is provided and the main treatment
      components are reviewed. These components include psycho-education, coping skills
      and exposure. Finally, we discuss the role that parents play in the
      implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy with anxious children.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of exposure and acceptance strategies to improve
      functioning and quality of life in longstanding pediatric pain--a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 248-57
LID - 10.1016/j.pain.2008.11.006 [doi]
AB  - Although several studies have illustrated the effectiveness of cognitive behavior
      therapy (CBT) on adult pain patients, there are few randomized controlled trials 
      on children and adolescents. There is particularly a need for studies on
      pediatric patients who are severely disabled by longstanding pain syndromes.
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, as an extension of traditional CBT, focuses on
      improving functioning and quality of life by increasing the patient's ability to 
      act effectively in concordance with personal values also in the presence of pain 
      and distress. Following a pilot study, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of
      an ACT-oriented intervention based on exposure and acceptance strategies and to
      compare this with a multidisciplinary treatment approach including amitriptyline 
      (n=32). The ACT condition underwent a relatively brief treatment protocol of
      approximately 10 weekly sessions. Assessments were made before and immediately
      after treatment, as well as at 3.5 and 6.5 months follow-up. Prolonged treatment 
      in the MDT group complicated comparisons between groups at follow-up assessments.
      Results showed substantial and sustained improvements for the ACT group. When
      follow-up assessments were included, ACT performed significantly better than MDT 
      on perceived functional ability in relation to pain, pain intensity and to
      pain-related discomfort (intent-to-treat analyses). At post-treatment,
      significant differences in favor of the ACT condition were also seen in fear of
      re/injury or kinesiophobia, pain interference and in quality of life. Thus,
      results from the present study support previous findings and suggest the
      effectiveness of this ACT-oriented intervention for pediatric longstanding pain
      syndromes.

TI  - Effectiveness and specificity of a classroom-based group intervention in children
      and adolescents exposed to war in Lebanon.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness and specificity of a
      classroom-based psychosocial intervention after war. All students (n=2500) of six
      villages in Southern Lebanon designated as most heavily exposed to war received a
      classroom-based intervention delivered by teachers, consisting of
      cognitive-behavioural and stress inoculation training strategies. A random sample
      of treated students (n=101) and a matched control group (n=93) were assessed one 
      month post-war and one year later. Mental disorders and psychosocial stressors
      were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents -
      Revised with children and parents. War exposure was measured using the War Events
      Questionnaire. The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), separation
      anxiety disorder (SAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was examined
      pre-war, one month post-war (pre-intervention), and one year post-war.
      Specificity of treatment was determined by rating teachers' therapy diaries. The 
      rates of disorders peaked one month post-war and decreased over one year. There
      was no significant effect of the intervention on the rates of MDD, SAD or PTSD.
      Post-war MDD, SAD and PTSD were associated with pre-war SAD and PTSD, family
      violence parameters, financial problems and witnessing war events. These findings
      have significant policy and public health implications, given current practices
      of delivering universal interventions immediately post-war.

TI  - Brief report: exposure and response prevention for obsessive compulsive disorder 
      in a 12-year-old with autism.
PG  - 977-81
AB  - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) involves exaggerated or excessive worry about
      threatening and non-threatening stimuli coupled with impairing rituals believed
      to reduce anxiety. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by
      impairment in social and communicative activities as well as restricted and
      repetitive behaviors. Approximately 2% of children with ASD are also diagnosed
      with OCD. Although there is extensive research demonstrating the effectiveness of
      behavioral interventions for pediatric OCD, little is known about how effective
      these treatments are for children who have a dual diagnosis of OCD and ASD. This 
      report describes a 12-year-old male with Autism who was treated successfully with
      cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention. This case
      study provides initial support that cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in 
      symptom reduction for children with comorbid autism and OCD.

TI  - Practitioner review: assessment and treatment of refugee children and adolescents
      who have experienced war-related trauma.
PG  - 1197-210
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly clinicians are being asked to assess and treat young
      refugees, who have experienced traumatic events due to war and organised
      violence. However, evidence-based guidance remains scarce. METHOD: Published
      studies on the mental health difficulties of refugee children and adolescents,
      associated risk and protective factors, as well as effective interventions,
      particularly those designed to reduce war-related post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) symptoms, were identified and reviewed. The findings are summarised.
      RESULTS: Young refugees are frequently subjected to multiple traumatic events and
      severe losses, as well as ongoing stressors within the host country. Although
      young refugees are often resilient, many experience mental health difficulties,
      including PTSD, depression, anxiety and grief. An awareness of relevant risk and 
      protective factors is important. A phased model of intervention is often useful
      and the need for a holistic approach crucial. Promising treatments for
      alleviating symptoms of war-related PTSD include cognitive behavioural treatment 
      (CBT), testimonial psychotherapy, narrative exposure therapy (NET) and eye
      movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Knowledge of the particular
      needs of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC), working with interpreters,
      cross-cultural differences, medico-legal report writing and the importance of
      clinician self-care is also necessary. CONCLUSION: More research is required in

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment for specific phobias with a child demonstrating
      severe problem behavior and developmental delays.
PG  - 546-58
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBTs) are widely used for anxiety disorders in
      typically developing children; however, there has been no previous attempt to
      administer CBT for specific phobia (in this case study, one-session treatment) to
      developmentally or intellectually disabled children. This case study integrates
      both cognitive-behavioral and behavior analytic assessment techniques in the CBT 
      of water and height phobia in a 7-year-old male with developmental delays and
      severe behavior problems. One-session treatment [Ost, L. G. (1989). One-session
      treatment for specific phobias. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 27, 1-7; Ost, L. 
      G. (1997). Rapid treatment of specific phobias. In G. C. L. Davey (Ed.), Phobias:
      A handbook of theory, research, and treatment (pp. 227-247). New York: Wiley] was
      provided for water phobia and then 2 months later for height phobia. The massed
      exposure therapy sessions combined graduated in vivo exposure, participant
      modeling, cognitive challenges, reinforcement, and other techniques. Both
      indirect and direct observation measures were utilized to evaluate treatment
      efficacy. Results suggested CBT reduced or eliminated behavioral avoidance,
      specific phobia symptoms, and subjective fear. Negative vocalizations were
      reduced during height exposure following treatment. Vocalizations following
      treatment for water phobia were less clear and may have been indicative of
      typical 7-year-old protests during bath time. Findings indicate CBT can be
      effective for treating clinical fears in an individual with developmental
      disabilities and severe behavior. Future research in this population should
      examine CBT as an alternative to other techniques (e.g., forced exposure) for
      treating fears.

TI  - [Psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence--what is
      evidence-based?].
PG  - 191-201; quiz 201-2
AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most frequent mental disorders in children and
      adolescents. They are also an important risk factor for psychological
      disturbances in adulthood and require adequate treatment. The effectiveness of
      psychotherapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders today can no longer be
      questioned. However, a meta-analysis of treatment studies shows that so far, only
      cognitive-behavior therapy has proved, on the basis of randomized, controlled
      trials (RCT), to be successful in the treatment of anxiety disorders in children 
      and adolescents. Regardless of whether the cognitive behavior therapy took place 
      individually or in a group, or whether it was carried out with the child alone or
      with the inclusion of the family, no differences in the effectiveness were found.
      The follow-up data show that the therapy success persisted for several years and 
      that it was not limited only to the symptoms of anxiety. Although for many
      psychotherapeutic interventions there is still no empirical basis, initial RCT
      prove the short-term effectiveness of psychopharmacological treatment (SSRI). The
      central, empirically validated psychotherapeutic interventions include
      psychoeducation, cognitive treatment of dysfunctional thoughts, and systematic
      exposure to the situation triggering anxiety. These interventions will be
      presented briefly and open questions in psychotherapy research will be discussed 
      in the conclusion.

TI  - Recent developments in research and treatment for social phobia (social anxiety
      disorder).
PG  - 51-4
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review covers three themes of research that brought fresh
      data useful for clinical practice in a handicapping anxiety disorder: social
      phobia. Recent findings deriving from basic biological research, new forms of
      psychological therapies, and recent psychopharmacology controlled trials are
      reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: The basic neuroimaging research suggests that greater 
      activation of the amygdala to novel versus familiar faces may be an underlying
      trait marker for social phobia. Social phobia may represent a phenotype that
      expresses a genetically driven trait of social withdrawal, which may be related
      to infantile inhibited temperament (Kagan's syndrome). The development of virtual
      reality therapy as therapeutic tool for social phobia appeared promising in one
      controlled, but not randomized, study. A controlled study suggests that social
      phobias in children can be effectively treated with cognitive behavioural
      therapy. This represents an extension of the work done with adults. Venlafaxine
      appears an effective short-term treatment for social anxiety disorder in two
      controlled studies. A new compound, pregabalin, appeared clearly effective in a
      positive controlled study. This trial marks the advent of a new pharmacological
      lineage for social phobia. Both venlafaxine and pregabalin, however, have been
      studied in short-term studies. Longer follow-up and relapse prevention studies
      are warranted. SUMMARY: Neuroimaging research points to a temperamental basis for
      social phobia. Virtual reality therapy is an emerging tool to carry out exposure 
      treatment. Group cognitive behavioural therapy can be extended successfully to
      children. Venlafaxine and pregabalin have a proven short-term effectiveness in
      social phobia.

TI  - Family cognitive behavioral therapy for child anxiety disorders.
PG  - 314-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; 
      the Building Confidence Program) with traditional child-focused CBT with minimal 
      family involvement for children with anxiety disorders. METHOD: Forty clinically 
      anxious youth (6-13 years old) were randomly assigned to a family- or
      child-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Conditions were matched for
      therapist contact time. Both interventions included coping skills training and in
      vivo exposure, but the family CBT intervention also included parent communication
      training. Independent evaluator, parent, and child report measures with
      demonstrated validity and reliability were used to assess child anxiety symptom
      outcomes at pre- and posttreatment. The data analytic strategy involved an
      evaluable patient analysis. RESULTS: Compared with child-focused CBT, family CBT 
      was associated with greater improvement on independent evaluators' ratings and
      parent reports of child anxiety--but not children's self-reports--at
      posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment groups showed improvement on all
      outcome measures, but family CBT may provide additional benefit over and above
      child-focused CBT. These findings provide preliminary support for the efficacy of
      the "Building Confidence" program and encourage further research in parental
      participation in treatment for childhood anxiety.

TI  - [Treatment of anxiety syndrome. A systematic literature review. Summary and
      conclusions by the SBU].
PG  - 3561-2, 3565-6, 3569
AB  - A report by the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) has
      reviewed, classified and evaluated the scientific literature on treatment of
      panic syndrome, specific phobias, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive syndrome
      (OCD), generalized anxiety syndrome (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). The review included treatment of children, adolescents and adults. The
      report concludes that there is effective treatment available for all anxiety
      syndromes. However in general, the effect is often moderate and symptoms reappear
      when the treatment period is discontinued. For adults, scientific evidence
      supports the use of paroxetine and sertraline for all syndromes except specific
      phobias. For the other SSRI's there is also evidence for the use of fluoxetin in 
      OCD and PTSD, for fluvoxamine in social phobia and OCD and for escitalopram in
      social phobia. Other antidepressant drugs with a strong scientific support is
      venlafaxin in social phobia and GAD, imipramin in panic syndrome and
      chlomipramine in panic syndrome and OCD. Among psychological treatments, there is
      scientific evidence for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for treatment of panic
      syndrome, specific phobias, social phobia, PTSD and GAD. Exposure, with or
      without other psychotherapeutic interventions, has scientific support for
      efficacy in panic disorder (both in terms of number of panic attacks and for
      agoraphobia), specific phobias, OCD and PTSD. Use of eye movement desensitization
      and reprocessing (EMDR) has scientific support for treatment of PTSD.

TI  - Emerging treatments for child and adolescent social phobia: a review.
PG  - 589-607
AB  - Social anxiety disorder, or social phobia (SP), is an anxiety disorder
      characterized by excessive fear of exposure to situations that involve potential 
      scrutiny by others. SP is a common psychiatric problem in children and
      adolescents, often presenting with comorbid anxiety and mood disorders. Although 
      the onset of SP is typically in late childhood or early adolescence, most
      afflicted individuals go undiagnosed for years, not seeking treatment until
      adulthood. First-line treatments for SP in adults support the use of
      pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. There is new and emerging data 
      in youths with SP to support the use of similar treatments. This paper will
      review the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and treatment of SP in youths.
      Current investigations using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
      serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and monoamine
      oxidase inhibitors in youths will be reviewed. Several studies on the use of
      cognitive behavioral therapy in youths will also be examined. Practical
      guidelines for clinicians who treat children and adolescents are also presented.

TI  - Cognitive-behavior therapy for childhood anxiety disorders.
PG  - 863-76, x
AB  - Over the past decade, multiple controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy
      of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for the treatment of anxiety disorders in
      children and adolescents. Relying heavily on behavioral exposure, cognitive
      restructuring, and psychoeducation, CBT for child anxiety has been shown to be
      adaptable to a variety of implementation formats, including individual, family,
      and group treatment. This article describes the conceptual framework underlying
      CBT and the key elements of this treatment approach. Important developmental and 
      family considerations in treatment are discussed, and the empirical literature is
      reviewed.

TI  - WCA recommendations for the long-term treatment of social phobia.
PG  - 40-52
AB  - What is the best approach for treating patients with social phobia (social
      anxiety disorder) over the long term? Social phobia is the most common anxiety
      disorder, with reported prevalence rates of up to 18.7%. Social phobia is
      characterized by a marked and persistent fear of being observed or evaluated by
      others in social performance or interaction situations and is associated with
      physical, cognitive, and behavioral (ie, avoidance) symptoms. The onset of social
      phobia typically occurs in childhood or adolescence and the clinical course, if
      left untreated, is usually chronic, unremitting, and associated with significant 
      functional impairment. Social phobia exhibits a high degree of comorbidity with
      other psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and
      substance abuse/dependence. Few people with social phobia seek professional help 
      despite the existence of beneficial treatment approaches. The efficacy,
      tolerability, and safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
      evidenced in randomized clinical trials, support these agents as first-line
      treatment. The benzodiazepine clonazepam and certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors
      (representing both reversible and nonreversible inhibitors) may also be of
      benefit. Treatment of social phobia may need to be continued for several months
      to consolidate response and achieve full remission. The SSRIs have shown benefit 
      in long-term treatment trials, while long-term treatment data from clinical
      studies of clonazepam are limited but support the drug's efficacy. There is also 
      evidence for the effectiveness of exposure-based strategies of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, and controlled studies suggest that the effects of 
      treatment are generally maintained at long-term follow-up. In light of the
      chronicity and disability associated with social phobia, as well as the high
      relapse rate after short-term therapy, it is recommended that effective treatment
      be continued for at least 12 months.

TI  - Exposure-based cognitive-behavioral treatment for phobic and anxiety disorders:
      treatment effects and maintenance for Hispanic/Latino relative to
      European-American youths.
PG  - 1179-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine treatment response and maintenance to exposure-based
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for Hispanic/Latino relative to
      European-American youths with phobic and anxiety disorders. METHOD: A total of
      131 Hispanic/Latino and European-American youths (aged 6-16 years) who
      participated in two previous clinical trials for phobic and anxiety disorders
      were compared along diagnostic recovery rates, clinically significant
      improvement, and youth- and parent-completed questionnaire scores using
      traditional hypothesis tests, including effect sizes, and statistical equivalence
      tests. RESULTS: After treatment, Hispanic/Latino and European-American youths
      responded similarly to exposure-based CBT in their diagnostic recovery rates and 
      questionnaires. Effect sizes for questionnaire data were also more similar than
      different across the two groups. With regard to treatment maintenance,
      Hispanic/Latino and European-American youths also responded more similarly than
      differently, albeit with some variations within specific assessment points in
      questionnaire data. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure-based CBT for phobic and anxiety
      disorders produced positive treatment gains and maintenance for Hispanic/Latino
      youths who participated in the trials. The treatment response that can be
      expected is generally similar (i.e., favorable) and equivalent to that found with
      European-American youths based on all the available indices of change.

TI  - Pharmacologic treatment approaches for children and adolescents with
      posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 251-69
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common cause of morbidity in children and
      adolescents. The disorder in youth is similar to that in adults, with high rates 
      of psychiatric comorbidity. Children seem to be more sensitive to the effects of 
      trauma, and early life trauma exposure may induce a complex sequence of events
      that leads to the development of multiple psychiatric disorders in adulthood. The
      state of knowledge regarding medication treatments for children and adolescents
      is in the earliest stages of development. There are no well-conducted, randomized
      clinical trials to guide practitioners. Medication may play an important role in 
      reducing debilitating symptoms of PTSD and providing a buffer for children while 
      they confront difficult material in therapy and may help to improve their general
      functioning in day-to-day life. Given the various medications with potential
      usefulness in PTSD, it is helpful to use a stepwise approach to treatment. As a
      general principal, broad-spectrum agents, such as the SSRIs, are a good first
      choice. The SSRIs have efficacy in treating the core symptoms of PTSD and
      conditions such as the anxiety disorders and depression that commonly co-occur
      with PTSD. These agents also improve social and occupational functioning and an
      individual's perception of improved quality of life [41, 45, 46]. Although the
      SSRIs are generally effective for a broad spectrum of problems, clinicians should
      systematically monitor for the persistence of symptoms that do not respond to
      these agents. For example, despite significant improvements in core PTSD symptoms
      in one study that used sertraline, little improvement was seen in patients'
      comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms [41]. This finding demonstrates the
      value of continuous symptom monitoring and shows that residual or comorbid
      symptoms may require a different medication to augment effective SSRI treatment
      for PTSD. A reasonable approach is to begin with a broad-spectrum agent, such as 
      an SSRI, which should target anxiety, mood, and reexperiencing symptoms.
      Adrenergic agents, such as clonidine, used either alone or in combination with an
      SSRI may be useful when symptoms of hyperarousal and impulsivity are problematic.
      Supplementing with a mood stabilizer may be necessary in severe affective
      dyscontrol. Similarly, introduction of an atypical neuroleptic agent may be
      necessary in cases of severe self-injurious behavior, dissociation, psychosis, or
      aggression. Comorbid conditions such as ADHD should be targeted with
      pharmacotherapy known to be effective, such as psychostimulants or newer agents
      such as atomoxetine. Pharmacologic treatment of PTSD in childhood is one approach
      to alleviating the acute and chronic symptoms of the disorder. Despite the lack
      of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials that support efficacy, medication
      can be used in a rational and safe manner. Reduction in even one disabling
      symptom, such as insomnia or hyperarousal, may have a positive ripple effect on a
      child's overall functioning. Pharmacotherapy is typically used as one component
      of a more comprehensive multiple modality treatment package, including
      psychoeducation of the parent and child, focused exposure-based psychotherapy
      with adjunctive family therapy when indicated, and long-term booster
      interventions that use an admixture of psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and
      pharmacologic interventions.

PG  - 768-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a school-based group 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety disorders with African-American 
      adolescents. METHOD: Twelve adolescents (mean age = 15.6 years) with anxiety
      disorders were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 6) or a group attention-support
      control condition (AS-Control; n = 6). Both groups met for 10 sessions in the
      same high school. Key treatment ingredients in CBT involved exposure, relaxation,
      social skills, and cognitive restructuring. Key ingredients in AS-Control
      involved therapist and peer support. At pre- and posttreatment, diagnostic
      interviews were conducted, and adolescents completed self-report measures of
      anxiety. RESULTS: At posttreatment and among those who attended more than one
      treatment session, 3/4 adolescents in CBT no longer met diagnostic criteria for
      their primary anxiety disorder, compared with 1/5 in AS-Control. Clinician
      ratings of impairment and self-report levels of overall anxiety were
      significantly lower at posttreatment in CBT compared with AS-Control. Teenagers
      in both groups reported lower levels of social anxiety from pre- to
      posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the feasibility of implementing a
      manual-based CBT in an urban school setting. Responder rates among
      African-American adolescents were similar to those found in studies with white
      youths.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a common and debilitating anxiety disorder that 
      is often seen in children and adolescents. In adults, cognitive-behavioral
      therapy has been demonstrated to be an efficacious and cost-effective treatment. 
      Research with children is ongoing and preliminary results point toward
      cognitive-behavioral therapy as an appropriate first-line treatment. Successful
      cognitive-behavioral therapy with children requires not only skills in the
      application of behavioral techniques, such as exposure and ritual prevention, but
      also an understanding of how developmental issues impact treatment response and
      how to modify the therapeutic approach to match the child's needs. In this
      article, we review the outcome literature on cognitive-behavioral therapy for
      pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder and discuss its successful application.

TI  - Trauma in children and adolescents: risk and treatment of psychiatric sequelae.
PG  - 519-31
AB  - The recent wave of terrorism affecting the United States and other countries
      raises concerns about the welfare of children and adolescents. This review is
      designed to address such concerns by summarizing data from two scientific areas. 
      First, a series of recent studies examine psychiatric outcomes over time in
      children exposed to various forms of trauma. This review summarizes data on the
      various psychiatric consequences of childhood exposure to trauma, with specific
      emphasis on identifying factors that predict psychiatric outcome. Prior studies
      suggest that level of exposure, evidence of psychopathology before trauma
      exposure, and disruption in social support networks consistently emerge as strong
      predictors of psychopathology following exposure to trauma. Hence, clinicians
      might monitor children exposed to trauma most closely when they present with
      these risk factors. Second, a series of randomized controlled trials documents
      the beneficial effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in children exposed 
      to sexual abuse. When combined with other data from open studies and controlled
      trials in nontraumatized children, these studies suggest that CBT represents a
      logical therapeutic option for children developing anxiety symptoms following the
      recent wave of terrorism. In terms of psychopharmacological treatments, data from
      randomized controlled trials in traumatized children have not been generated, but
      recent studies in other groups of children exhibiting symptoms of anxiety or
      depression suggest the utility of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

PG  - 713-26
AB  - Fifty children aged 7-14 years with a principal diagnosis of social phobia were
      randomly assigned to either child-focused cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT), CBT 
      plus parent involvement, or a wait list control (WLC). The integrated CBT program
      involved intensive social skills training combined with graded exposure and
      cognitive challenging. At posttreatment, significantly fewer children in the
      treatment conditions retained a clinical diagnosis of social phobia compared to
      the WLC condition. In comparison to the WLC, children in both CBT interventions
      showed significantly greater reductions in children's social and general anxiety 
      and a significant increase in parental ratings of child social skills
      performance. At 12-month follow-up, both treatment groups retained their
      improvement. There was a trend towards superior results when parents were
      involved in treatment, but this effect was not statistically significant.

      obsessions in both children and adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
      are related to a fear of dirt and contamination, fear of some terrible happening,
      and the fear of harming a loved one. The most common compulsions are washing
      fixations, checking behaviour and rituals (including mental rituals). Prevalence 
      studies show that OCD in children and adolescents is far more common than
      previously thought. It is estimated that up to 2% of this population have
      symptoms fulfilling OCD criteria. The impact of early OCD onset can be profound, 
      with long-term studies indicating that approximately 50% of these patients will
      also suffer from OCD in early adulthood. These patients tend to remain socially
      isolated, to have fewer relationships than their non-OCD peers, and have a
      tendency to remain within the family home during early adulthood. In addition,
      childhood OCD is associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders, in particular
      depression, anxiety and panic disorders, Tourette's syndrome and eating
      disorders. Treatment strategies for childhood OCD reflect those used in adult
      psychiatry. The most effective psychotherapeutic approach is based on
      cognitive-behavioural therapy with exposure and prevention. In contrast to
      pharmacotherapeutic agents without serotonin activity, the serotonin-specific
      antidepressants appear to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of OCD
      in children.

PG  - 27S-45S
AB  - These practice parameters describe the assessment and treatment of
      obsessive-compulsive disorder based on a detailed literature review and expert
      consultation. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a disorder of heterogeneous origin
      characterized by intrusive thoughts or compulsive urges or behaviors that are
      distressing, time-consuming, or functionally impairing. In children and
      adolescents, the disorder often is accompanied by a wide range of comorbidity,
      including mood, anxiety, attentional, and learning difficulties, and/or tic
      disorder. These parameters describe the relevant areas of assessment, especially 
      symptomatology, onset, and course, other associated psychopathology, and
      developmental, family, and medical history (including postinfectious onset or
      exacerbations). Two modalities have been systematically assessed and empirically 
      shown to ameliorate core symptoms: cognitive-behavioral therapy (primarily
      exposure/response prevention) and serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication. Data
      regarding the indications, efficacy, and implementation of these modalities are
      reviewed. Because OCD frequently occurs in the context of other psychopathology
      and adaptive difficulties, additional individual and family psychotherapeutic,
      pharmacological, and educational interventions often are necessary. Treatment
      planning guidelines are provided.

PG  - 366-80
AB  - Ninety-four children (aged 9-13 years) with anxiety disorders were randomly
      assigned to cognitive behavioral treatment or waiting-list control. Outcomes were
      evaluated using diagnostic status, child self-reports, parent and teacher
      reports, cognitive assessment and behavioral observation: maintenance was
      examined using 1-year follow-up data. Analyses of dependent measures indicated
      significant improvements over time, with the majority indicating greater gains
      for those receiving treatment. Treatment gains returned cases to within
      nondeviant limits (i.e., normative comparisons) and were maintained at 1-year
      follow-up. Client age and comorbid status did not moderate outcomes. A
      preliminary examination of treatment segments suggested that the enactive
      exposure (when it follows cognitive-educational training) was an active force in 
      beneficial change. Discussion includes suggestions for future research.
