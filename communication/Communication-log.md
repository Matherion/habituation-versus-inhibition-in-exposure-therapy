Template mail to obtain materials

Dear dr. ....,
We are currently conducting a meta-analysis on active ingredients in exposure therapy, in which we wish to include your paper “Transdiagnostic group behavioral activation and exposure therapy for youth anxiety and depression: Initial randomized controlled trial” that appeared in Behaviour Research and Therapy (2016).
 
In order to obtain complete data, we would like to consult the therapist manual and youth workbook. The paper mentions that these are available from you as first author. 
Would you please be so kind to send us the workbook and manual? 
 
We are particularly interested in the specific way the exposure sessions were designed and carried out (i.e. was the duration of exposure determined by a decrease in anxiety, or by a prespecified time?); so if a complete manual is not available, a detailed description of the exposure instructions would suffice.
 
Details on our project are and will be available (following open science guidelines) at the Open Science Framework repository at https://osf.io/3nze4/
 
Kind regards,

Dear dr.  Lindner,
I and my colleagues are looking for the GBAT treatment protocol (more information below), and since the first author of this study, Brian Chu, is currently on paternity leave and can't provide us with an answer, I have found your contact details as one of the authors on this study.  I hope that you can provide us with information or a contact of another team member who can. Kind regards, 
dr. Eva de Hullu

Dear dr. Ginsburg,
We are currently conducting a meta-analysis on active ingredients in exposure therapy, in which we wish to include two of your papers “Treating Anxiety Disorders in Inner City Schools: Results from a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing CBT and Usual Care (2012) and School-Based Treatment for Anxious African-American Adolescents: A Controlled Pilot Study (2002). In these studies you describe using a modified version of the group CBT manual of Silverman and colleagues. In order to obtain complete data, we would like to consult the treatment manual. The paper mentions that these are available from you as first author.
