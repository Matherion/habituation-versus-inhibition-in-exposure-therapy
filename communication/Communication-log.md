### Template1: mail to obtain materials ###

Dear dr. ....,
We are currently conducting a meta-analysis on active ingredients in exposure therapy, in which we wish to include your paper “Transdiagnostic group behavioral activation and exposure therapy for youth anxiety and depression: Initial randomized controlled trial” that appeared in Behaviour Research and Therapy (2016). 
 
In order to obtain complete data, we would like to consult the therapist manual and youth workbook. The paper mentions that these are available from you as first author. 
Would you please be so kind to send us the workbook and manual?  

We are particularly interested in the specific way the exposure sessions were designed and carried out (i.e. was the duration of exposure determined by a decrease in anxiety, or by a prespecified time?); so if a complete manual is not available, a detailed description of the exposure instructions would suffice.
 
Details on our project are and will be available (following open science guidelines) at the Open Science Framework repository at https://osf.io/3nze4/
 
Kind regards,
 
Eva de Hullu, PhD

### Template2: reminder mail to obtain materials ###
Dear dr. ...,

About a week ago, we sent you an email (see below) with a request for materials for a meta-analysis on exposure therapy. If you would like to share your materials with us, we'd be very happy with your reply.
Kind regards,
Eva de Hullu

### Template3: thank you mail after obtaining materials ###
Thank you very much for your response and the manual. We will keep the document outside of our own repositories to prevent it from appearing online at any time, and welcome very much your willingness to share this information for our research purposes. 
Kind regards,
Eva

Dear dr.  Lindner,
I and my colleagues are looking for the GBAT treatment protocol (more information below), and since the first author of this study, Brian Chu, is currently on paternity leave and can't provide us with an answer, I have found your contact details as one of the authors on this study.  I hope that you can provide us with information or a contact of another team member who can. Kind regards,

Eva de Hullu mailed the corresponding author of **Peris2015**
to request data that wasn't reported. tperis@mednet.ucla.edu

> We are currently conducting a meta-analysis on active ingredients in exposure therapy, in which we would very much like to include your paper: Trajectories of Change in Youth Anxiety During Cognitive - Behavior Therapy (Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 2015). We were very interested in the approach you took in this paper to understand the working mechanisms of CBT. However, the trajectories of change method also means that baseline and posttreatment means and standard deviations were not reported. Having those descriptives would allow us to compare your study to other studies that tested exposure in anxious children. 
In order to being able to include your paper, we would need the means and standard deviations of the PARS scores of the CBT and PBO groups, at baseline and at post-treatment. We would be very grateful if you’d be able to provide us with those data.
